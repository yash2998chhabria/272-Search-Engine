After several hours of incubation at 4 degrees C (pH 7.4) stable acetaldehyde-RNase adducts were formed, and the extent of their formation was similar regardless of the presence of phosphate. Although the total amount of covalent binding was comparable in the absence or presence of phosphate, this active site ligand prevented the inhibition of enzymatic activity seen in its absence. This protective action of phosphate diminished with progressive ethylation of RNase, indicating that the reversible association of phosphate with the active site lysyl residue was overcome by the irreversible process of reductive ethylation. Modified RNase was analysed using 13C proton decoupled NMR spectroscopy. Peaks arising from the covalent binding of enriched acetaldehyde to free amino groups in the absence of phosphate were as follows: NH2-terminal alpha amino group, 47.3 ppm; bulk ethylation at epsilon amino groups of nonessential lysyl residues, 43.0 ppm; and the epsilon amino group of lysine-41 at the active site, 47.4 ppm. In the spectrum of RNase ethylated in the presence of phosphate, the peak at 47.4 ppm was absent. When RNase was selectively premethylated in the presence of phosphate, to block all but the active site lysyl residues and then ethylated in its absence, the signal at 43.0 ppm was greatly diminished, and that arising from the active site lysyl residue at 47.4 ppm was enhanced. These results indicate that phosphate specifically protected the active site lysine from reaction with acetaldehyde, and that modification of this lysine by acetaldehyde adduct formation resulted in inhibition of catalytic activity.', 'author': 'Mauch TJ; Tuma DJ; Sorrell MF.', 'source': 'Alcohol Alcohol 8801; 22(2):103-12'}\n",

In addition we measured cytosolic calcium concentration and its increase following activation by FMLP. In all culture combinations recharge resulted in the recovery of greater than 2 X 10(6) cells/flask (95% neutrophils, 98% viable). Histologic studies of cytoplasmic markers indicated that recovered neutrophils were derived from the stem cell population employed for recharge. For each neutrophil parameter measured, function was markedly improved when old hematopoietic stem cells were recharged onto a young stroma and was significantly diminished when young stem cells were recharged onto an old stroma. This applied to superoxide generation, basal and stimulated enzyme levels, and to basal cytosolic calcium concentration and its increase following activation by FMLP. These results indicate that when old hematopoietic stem cells proliferate in a young microenvironment, neutrophil function returns virtually to normal. Conversely, function diminishes when young stem cells proliferate in an old stroma. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that neutrophil function is modulated by microenvironmental factors, hormonal, cellular, or matrix, which are decreased in the elderly. That an age-related decline in function is extrinsic to the cell and is reversible has significance for the study of neutrophil function and of cellular aging and has potential therapeutic implications.', 'author': 'Lipschitz DA; Udupa KB; Boxer LA.', 'source': 'Blood 8801; 70(4):1131-5'}\n",

Patients were considered unsuitable for hindquarter amputation on clinical grounds if malignant disease infiltrated into the perineum or across the sacro-iliac joint. If disease in the femoral triangle extended above the inguinal ligament the tumour's operability was seriously questioned. Buttock tumours which had passed through the greater sciatic notch to become palpable on pelvic examination were also considered likely to be inoperable. On computed tomographic (CT) examination, tumours were considered inoperable if the psoas muscle was involved above the inguinal ligament, or if malignant disease involved the sacro-iliac joint, sacrum or perineal structures. Soft tissue tumours of the buttock extending significantly through the greater sciatic notch were also considered likely to be inoperable. Five patients thought suitable for hindquarter amputation on clinical assessment had no excluding features on CT; four undergoing hindquarter amputation were proven on histological examination to have good clearance of their tumours. In another patient, considered suitable for hindquarter amputation on clinical grounds, CT suggested that en bloc wide excision of the tumour was feasible enabling the affected limb to be preserved. Four patients after clinical examination were considered unsuitable for hindquarter amputation and in all cases inoperability was confirmed by CT.

The intensity of the test stimuli was 1.1 to 1.25 times threshold for the first recruited axons (defined as a compound action potential of approximately 0.5 microV). The amplitude of the test volley did not reach the control amplitude until conditioning-test intervals of 3.4 ms. This was followed by a period of increased axonal excitability which reached a peak at intervals of 5 to 8 ms and declined gradually into a late phase of subnormality at 15 to 20 ms. The amplitude of the submaximal test potential was potentiated by, on average, 47% (range 9-146%) during the supernormal period. There were no significant changes in latency. The time course and the degree of potentiation were reproducible in the same subject on separate occasions. When the limb was cooled, the latency of the onset of supernormality was increased and the degree of supernormality was decreased and ultimately abolished. There was an inverse relationship between the degree of potentiation and the size of the test volley. High-frequency repetitive stimulation of the digital nerves for 10 min modified axonal excitability and produced spontaneous paraesthesiae that lasted for 20 min after the stimulation. Following this prolonged stimulus train, single submaximal stimuli evoked larger cutaneous afferent potentials than before the train, and the extent of the potentiation during the supernormal period was increased.

Displacement amplitude, peak instantaneous velocity, and movement time were evaluated during repetitive syllable productions. The results showed that while mean parkinsonian displacement amplitudes and velocities were lower than the normal control subjects, there was no statistical relationship between labial rigidity and the degree of movement abnormality. It is concluded that while rigidity may play a part in the overall disability, it does not sufficiently explain the labial articulatory difficulties associated with parkinsonism.

Alternative suggestions have been that myelinolysis is due to uncorrected hyponatraemia, that it occurs only with over-correction of hyponatraemia or that it is due to coincidental hypoxia. The following experiments were undertaken to clarify the relationship between myelinolysis and derangements of serum sodium and their treatment. Severe hyponatraemia ([Na+] less than or equal to 122 mmol/l) was produced in three groups of rabbits by injection of vasopressin and 5% dextrose in water. Rabbits with severe uncorrected hyponatraemia sustained for seven days or more did not show myelinolysis at autopsy. Myelinolytic lesions did develop in 3 of 7 rabbits in a second group in which corrective infusion of hypertonic saline was administered after only three days of severe hyponatraemia. Neurological deterioration also occurred in rabbits in the third group which received hypertonic saline within 24h of developing severe hyponatraemia. In this group no lesions were apparent at autopsy. No animal became hypernatraemic with correction. These results indicate that even prolonged severe hyponatraemia does not lead to myelinolysis if it remains uncorrected, but that rapid correction of hyponatraemia, without over-correction, can cause neurological disease.

The residual vision underlying their responses was characterized by low flicker-fusion and by sensitivity in detection of movement which increased as target speed was raised. Discrimination for the direction of target movement was poor, but spatial resolution in the discrimination of target displacement was essentially normal. The subjects were unable to recognize or discriminate the spatial structure of targets located within the 'blind' field, and the observed dissociation between spatial discrimination of displacement and pattern is examined in relation to the 'two systems' hypothesis of visual function.

The rCBF measurements were performed in conjunction with cerebral angiography. During repeated rCBF measurements all 3 patients developed focal hypoperfusion originating in the frontal lobe, subsequently spreading posteriorly to involve the precentral and postcentral regions. In 2 cases focal hyperperfusion appeared to precede the hypoperfusion. In association with the rCBF changes the patients developed transient motor and/or sensory deficits and subsequently severe headache. No signs of arterial occlusion were found. In the over and underperfused regions blood flow fluctuated rapidly because of instability of cerebrovascular tone, defined as transient constriction of the smallest cerebral vessels (arterioles) alternating with a normal calibre for these vessels and/or short periods of vasodilatation. It is considered to be a primary pathological condition of the vessels. When vasoconstriction was present the blood flow decreased to values consistent with ischaemia, which was probably the cause of the neurological deficits.

The patients' performance and event-related potential wave forms for the 'oddball' task were no different from those of the controls. In the digit probe identification tasks the patients showed a reduction in amplitude of a positive component at a latency of approximately 450 ms (P450) of the event-related potential to correctly identified probes in the auditory modality. This component was within normal limits with visual testing. There was an inordinate increase in the patients' reaction time to auditory but not visual stimuli when the number of items to be remembered increased from one to three. Event-related potentials were also analysed as a function of speed of reaction time, position of the matching item in the stimulus presentation set and whether the probe was correctly identified as being in-set or out-of-set. Event-related potentials associated with fast reaction times in the auditory task when a single item was presented were no different between patients and controls, indicating that patients were capable of both performing normally and generating normal potentials on some trials.

The participants' knowledge and skills were measured before training and immediately after, 6 months after and 12 months after training. Information on all attempts at CPR involving hospital staff was collected from medical records and from interviews with the participants. A total of 31 physicians and 54 nurses were followed during the study. Six months after training there was no difference in CPR knowledge or skills between the physicians and the nurses. In both groups CPR skills had deteriorated to near pretraining levels. By 6 months the physicians' knowledge had deteriorated to a level not significantly different from that before training. The nurses maintained a significant improvement in knowledge test scores at 12 months over those before training (p = 0.037). The physicians had an accurate perception of their knowledge but not their skills 6 months and 12 months after training, whereas the nurses did not accurately perceive either their knowledge or their skills after training. Experience with CPR did not contribute to post-training knowledge or skills in either group. There was no evidence that death rates were lower when basic life support (BLS) was begun by trained staff than when it was begun by untrained staff. The probability of survival was greater when BLS was begun within 4 minutes of arrest than when it was begun after 4 minutes, regardless of whether advanced cardiac life support was begun within 10 minutes.\", 'author': 'Curry L; Gass D.', 'source': 'Can Med Assoc J 8801; 137(6):491-6'}\n",

Increases were also noted in hospital admission/separation rates, especially among those less than 15 years of age. Hospital admission/separation rates were highest in the Maritime provinces and Saskatchewan, whereas death rates were highest in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Examination of death certificates for coding errors and recoding of certificates to a single (8th) revision of the International Classification of Diseases indicated that changes in disease coding and errors in coding did not account for the significant increase in rates of death from asthma for those aged 15 to 34 years.

The articles that essentially satisfied our criteria suggested that duration and severity of dementia best predicted reversibility and the need for computed tomography of the head. A decision rule may be used to select among a number of investigations now advocated as routine in diagnosing dementia, with little or no risk of missing clinically significant diagnoses and with appreciable cost savings.

Characteristics including sex, age, histologic type, extrathyroid invasion, and lymph node metastasis were examined in each subgroup. In patients with minute carcinoma, very few incidences of extrathyroid invasion and lymph node metastasis were found. However, these involvements, especially lymph node metastasis, were found more frequently in patients with tiny carcinoma. The incidence of cervical lymph node metastasis was 13% in minute carcinoma and 59% in tiny carcinoma. (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest the need for more careful observation and treatment of tiny carcinomas, especially with respect to lymph node metastasis.

The papillary carcinoma and follicular carcinoma ratios were compared between the two subgroups. The discovery rate of follicular carcinoma was significantly higher in minute carcinoma than in tiny carcinoma (P less than 0.005).

Considerable histologic heterogeneity was noted including epithelioid, myxoid, and sclerotic variants. Stratification by histologic grade suggests important clinical subsets. Only in grade I tumors is surgical extirpation alone potentially curative. Grade II tumors are associated with meaningful survival usually measured in years, however, nearly all patients can be expected to die from their tumors. Grade III sarcomas are fully malignant and rapidly progressive: except for one case with limited follow-up, all patients with Grade III sarcomas died of disease with a mean survival of only nine months (median, 2 months).

Five FCM patterns were defined on the basis of DNA and RNA indexes in relationship to peripheral blood lymphocytes. FCM results were compared to cytologic findings in 237 cases, cystoscopic findings in 230 cases, and histologic data in 99 cases. Presence of a single diploid stem line was associated with absence of bladder tumor in 71% of cases from patients treated with surgery alone or with radiation therapy, but there was residual tumor in 53% of patients exposed to prior local chemotherapy. An elevated RNA content in a diploid cell population did not provide additional diagnostic information. Presence of an aneuploid stem line was associated with tumor in 85% of cases, regardless of prior therapy. Aneuploidy predicted the appearance of tumor in four of six patients with a negative cystoscopy.

Although several studies have been performed on the correlation of the consumption of hot tea and esophageal cancer, no research has heretofore documented, by actually measuring, the temperature at which the tea is consumed. Therefore, a tea temperature measurement study was carried out in the Caspian Littoral of Iran, where the frequency of esophageal cancer is the highest in the world. The study was conducted during a population-food-habits survey in 1968 to 1969, which was performed before statistics were available regarding the incidence rate or geographic distribution of this disease in the region. Ten years later, when the results of the Caspian Cancer Registry were analyzed, the data from this nutritional study was compared with the regional distribution of esophageal cancer. A geographic correlation exists between the frequency of consumption of hot tea and the incidence of esophageal cancer. Seventy-two percent of the people in the low-risk region of esophageal cancer drank their tea at the relatively moderate temperature of below 55 degrees C, compared with only 3% in the high risk region. More importantly, 62% of the adult population in the high-risk region, as opposed to 19% in the low-risk region, drank their tea at a temperature of over 65 degrees C. In addition to the thermal irritation of hot tea, the following considerations cannot be ignored: the carcinogenicity role of tannins; the cancer-promoting effect of phenols; and the absorption facilitating role of hot tea. Alcohol and tobacco, the most important risk factors for cancer of the esophagus in many countries, play a negligible role in the cause of this disease in northern Iran. In this region, nutritional deficiencies--a special diet for pregnant women composed of sour pomegranite seeds, black pepper, and garlic; consumption of bread contaminated with silica fibre; and ingestion of opium and opium dross--combined with long-lasting and daily thermal irritation of the esophagus with very hot tea play an important role in the development of this disease. The inhabitants of the high-risk area consumed roughly 2.5 times more tea than their counterparts in the low-risk area.

However, species differences in the inotropic response to these agents have raised questions about the relationship between PDE III inhibition and cardiotonic activity. The present study demonstrates that these differences can be accounted for by the presence of two subclasses of PDE III in ventricular muscle and variations in the intracellular localization of these two enzymes. For these experiments, PDE III was initially isolated from canine, guinea pig, and rat left ventricular muscle. The results demonstrate that canine left ventricular muscle contains two functional subclasses of PDE III: an imazodan-sensitive form, which is membrane bound, and an imazodan-insensitive form, which is soluble. Although only weakly inhibited by imazodan, this latter enzyme is potently inhibited by the selective PDE III inhibitors, Ro 20-1724 and rolipram. Guinea pig ventricular muscle also contains the imazodan-sensitive subclass of PDE III. Unlike canine left ventricle, however, thi enzyme is soluble in the guinea pig. No membrane-bound subclass of PDE III was observed in the guinea pig. Rat left ventricle possesses only the soluble form of PDE III, which apparently represents a mixture of the imazodan-sensitive and imazodan-insensitive subclasses of PDE III.

Calcium and sodium gain, loss of intracellular components, and changes in structure were monitored. If 30 mM BDM was added at the time of calcium repletion after 10 minutes of calcium-free perfusion, some protection was afforded, particularly at the early stages of calcium repletion. However, much greater protection was obtained if BDM was present during the final 2 minutes of calcium-free perfusion and throughout repletion. Sodium gain and loss of intracellular components were markedly attenuated, as was the incidence of severely contracted cells. Calcium gain, although significantly reduced during the period of repletion, was not abolished. After 10 minutes of repletion, a calcium content of 11.44 +/- 1.57 mumol/g dry wt was observed. This suggests that other noncontracture related routes of calcium entry are involved. If BDM is removed after 5 minutes of calcium repletion and perfusion is continued with BDM-free perfusate, there is a rapid gain of sodium, further gain of calcium, loss of intracellular components and the cells contract severely, tearing away from neighboring cells. It is evident, therefore, that returning calcium to hearts after a period of calcium-free perfusion under conditions that significantly reduce the typical calcium paradox-associated damage does not necessarily repair the underlying defect.

ACh (greater than 10(-7) M) transiently hyperpolarized the membrane (1-4 minutes) with an associated decrease in the membrane resistance, either in the presence or absence of NE, and these changes ceased during the continuous application of ACh. The ACh-induced transient hyperpolarization was not generated after mechanically removing the endothelium or by treatment with atropine. Oxotremorine (up to 10(-5) M) did not alter the membrane potential in the presence or absence of the endothelium. NE (10(-6) M) depolarized the smooth muscle membrane, which remained unchanged by additional application of ACh or oxotremorine for more than 5 minutes, or after removal of the endothelium.

These inhibitory actions of ACh or oxotremorine were blocked by atropine but were not affected by removal of the endothelial cells. These results suggest that the inhibitory actions of muscarinic agonists on electrical responses of smooth muscle cells of the rabbit saphenous artery were mainly indirect, i.e., a release of inhibitory substances from the endothelial cells and the inhibition of adrenergic transmission. The former required higher concentrations of ACh or oxotremorine, thereby suggesting that the latter may be more important for vasodilation related to cholinergic mechanisms.', 'author': 'Komori K; Suzuki H.', 'source': 'Circ Res 8801; 61(4):586-93'}\n",

The adenine nucleotide pool of endothelial cells was selectively labelled by infusing 3H-adenosine (5 X 10(-8) M) into the heart for 30 minutes. Selective labelling of the endothelial adenine nucleotides was confirmed by measuring the relative specific activities of the nucleotides of coronary endothelial cells (removed from the heart by enzyme treatment). Endothelial ATP, ADP, and AMP had relative specific activities that were 49, 25, and 7 times higher, respectively, than their nucleotide counterparts in total myocardial tissue. Isoproterenol increased the release of both total adenosine and radioactive adenosine, but the relative specific activity of venous adenosine decreased dramatically. Acetylcholine, at a concentration that caused no change in left ventricular pressure but caused a decrease in coronary vascular resistance, increased the release of total adenosine. However, both radioactive adenosine release and the relative specific activity of venous effluent adenosine were decreased with acetylcholine. Infusion of hydrochloric acid caused a sustained reduction in left ventricular pressure and coronary vascular resistance. Total adenosine release fell within one minute and remained reduced during HCl. Radioactive adenosine release was elevated at 15 seconds but fell below control values at 2 minutes and remained reduced during steady-state acidosis. We conclude that the majority of the adenosine released in response to isoproterenol and acetylcholine originates from an unlabelled compartment, most likely the myocytes. Acidosis results in decreased release of adenosine from both the labelled endothelium and the unlabelled cells in the heart.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 'author': 'Bardenheuer H; Whelton B; Sparks HV Jr.', 'source': 'Circ Res 8801; 61(4):594-600'}\n",

The response was significantly inhibited or totally blocked by the presence of superoxide dismutase 60 U/ml, catalase 46 U/ml, or deferoxamine 0.1 or 0.2 mM. The superoxide dismutase scavenges superoxide radical, which is known to enter the subarachnoid space as a consequence of cyclooxygenase activation. Cyclooxygenase is activated by bradykinin. The superoxide can form H2O2, scavenged by catalase, and the two together generate hydroxyl. The formation of hydroxyl radical is catalyzed by iron. Deferoxamine 0.1 mM scavenges the iron, blocking the generation of hydroxyl. Deferoxamine 0.2 mM also directly scavenges the hydroxyl. None of the pharmacologic probes had an effect on arteriolar diameter when locally applied without bradykinin. Since the dilation produced by bradykinin was inhibited or totally blocked by probes that prevented hydroxyl formation or directly scavenged hydroxyl radical, that radical is either an essential mediator of the arteriolar relaxation, or is the endothelium-dependent relaxing factor for bradykinin in pial arterioles.\", 'author': 'Rosenblum WI.', 'source': 'Circ Res 8801; 61(4):601-3'}\n",

The mechanisms converting mechanical events to electrical signals are unknown. Since it has not been possible to record a receptor potential in the mechanosensitive terminals, studies rely on interpretation of axonal discharge of baroreceptor endings. In the present study, the ionic sensitivity of in vitro preparations of both low- and high-pressure receptors are compared in studies in which the ionic composition of the extracellular fluid is controlled. The results taken together with previous work suggest uniformity of response to calcium, sodium, and potassium across a variety of cardiovascular receptor types supporting common mechanoelectrical transduction mechanisms. Decreased extracellular sodium produced increased threshold and decreased slopes of pressure-discharge curves for both aortic arch baroreceptors and for low-pressure baroreceptors in the atrium. Results are consistent with data for other mechanoreceptors where it is believed that distortion activates a relatively poorly selective cation-conducting channel through the membrane. As with arterial baroreceptors, increases in external calcium levels caused a decrease in the excitability of atrial baroreceptors. Substitution of half the external calcium with the inorganic calcium channel blocker cobalt failed to alter baroreceptor function. Bay K 8644, a calcium channel agonist of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, tended to inhibit baroreceptor discharge with effects consistent with smooth muscle activation within the vessel wall.

Severity and site of mitral regurgitation was evaluated by the real-time two-dimensional Doppler flow imaging technique in 81 patients with old myocardial infarction. The incidence of mitral regurgitation did not depend on the region of infarction. There was, however, a close relationship between the site of regurgitation and the region of infarction. In patients with mitral regurgitation spurting from the posteromedial area of the valve, the inferior wall was involved in infarction without exception and in some of these patients, the posteromedial papillary muscle was also found to be affected by myocardial infarction; in those with regurgitation spurting from the anterolateral area, the anterior wall showed asynergy. On the other hand in patients with mitral regurgitation spurting from the central area, the region of infarction varied. In these patients, however, the larger the diameter of the mitral anulus, the more severe the grade of regurgitation. The extent of asynergy was another factor related to the severity of mitral regurgitation. Both longitudinally and transversely, broad infarction leads to the enlargement of the mitral anulus. However, even if the mitral anulus is not so dilated, severe involvement of either commissural area results in severe mitral regurgitation from the same commissural side. Thus, there are two major causative factors of mitral regurgitation: (1) asynergy of the papillary muscle or the ventricle that results in mitral regurgitation located in the commissural area of the same side as asynergy, and (2) enlargement of mitral anulus, which results in regurgitation from the central area of the orifice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 'author': 'Izumi S; Miyatake K; Beppu S; Park YD; Nagata S; Kinoshita N; Sakakibara H; Nimura Y.', 'source': 'Circulation 8801; 76(4):777-85'}\n",

In a previous study we demonstrated improved recovery of ventricular function and metabolism when the superoxide radical scavenger superoxide dismutase was administered at the time of postischemic reflow. Studies in vitro, have suggested that superoxide toxicity might be mediated via the generation of more reactive hydroxyl radicals in an iron-catalyzed reaction. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that myocardial reperfusion injury might be reduced by administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine at the time of reflow, most likely by preventing hydroxyl radical formation. Sixteen isolated Langendorff rabbit hearts, perfused within the bore of a superconducting magnet, were subjected to 30 min of normothermic (37 degrees C) total global ischemia followed by 45 min of reperfusion. At reflow eight treated hearts received a 10 ml bolus containing 50 mumol of deferoxamine followed by an infusion of 11 mumol/min for the first 15 min of reflow. The hearts were then perfused with standard perfusate for an additional 30 min. Eight untreated control hearts received a similar bolus of perfusate followed by 45 min of standard reperfusion. Serial 5 min 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded. Myocardial phosphocreatine (PCr) content fell to 5% to 7% of control during ischemia in both groups of hearts. Deferoxamine-treated hearts recovered 99 +/- 10% of control PCr content, while untreated hearts recovered 60 +/- 16% (p less than .05). Intracellular pH fell to 5.9 during ischemia in both groups, before showing more rapid and complete recovery in treated hearts (p less than .01). Recovery of developed pressure reached 70 +/- 6% of control in treated hearts compared with 35 +/- 10% in untreated hearts (p less than .05). Iron content of the perfusate was 7 microM, and by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was in the form of Fe3+-EDTA complexes. In the effluent of treated hearts iron was in the form of Fe3+-deferoxamine chelates. In summary, administration of the iron chelator deferoxamine at the time of postischemic reflow results in greater recovery of myocardial function and energy metabolism, which supports the hypothesis that iron plays an important role in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury.', 'author': 'Ambrosio G; Zweier JL; Jacobus WE; Weisfeldt ML; Flaherty JT.', 'source': 'Circulation 8801; 76(4):906-15'}\n",

The preparation consisted of three 5 min occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery interspersed by 30 min of reperfusion. An equihypotensive dose of nicorandil (7.5 micrograms/kg/min) or ISDN (12.5 micrograms/kg/min) was infused 15 min before and during the second occlusion period. Hemodynamics, myocardial segment shortening (%SS), tissue blood flow, and myocardial oxygen consumption were determined throughout. Uptake of free fatty acids (FFA), glucose, and lactate were determined during control and ischemic periods. At the end of the final 30 min reperfusion period, biopsy samples of transmural tissue were taken for analysis of phosphocreatine, adenine nucleotides, and total tissue water content. No major hemodynamic changes were produced by either drug except for a 5 to 10 mm Hg decrease in mean aortic pressure. Compared with untreated and ISDN-treated hearts, hearts of dogs treated with nicorandil exhibited reversal of a significant increase in FFA uptake during recurrent ischemia. This was accompanied by an attenuation of the increase in oxygen extraction and CO2 production in the ischemic zone by nicorandil, but not by ISDN. Nicorandil, but not ISDN, improved %SS during reperfusion. Endocardial ATP and total adenine nucleotides were preserved in both nicorandil- and ISDN-treated hearts. Tissue edema was also attenuated by both compounds.

We fitted sigmoid curves to the data to model the distribution of wall thickening impairment as a function of distance from the perfusion boundary, which was delineated with myocardial blood flow (15 micron diameter microspheres) maps. Using this approach, we defined the functional border zone as the distance from the perfusion boundary to 97.5% of the sigmoid curve's nonischemic asymptote. The lateral extent of the functional border zone, measured 10 min and 3 hr after occlusion, was 32 and 28 degrees of circumference, respectively. To evaluate the severity of nonischemic dysfunction, we measured average systolic wall thickening within the functional border zone.

Many patients had difficulty functioning at head level for hygienic purposes. Many were unable to perform functions behind the back, although waist-level function approached normal. The position of rotation was the most critical factor in approaching optimum function. Fusions in positions of internal rotation reduced the ability to comb hair, wash the face, or to otherwise use the hand at head level. Fusion in a position of excessive external rotation made it impossible for the patient to reach the opposite axilla or belt buckle. There was a range of acceptability of abduction of forward flexion that did not appear to compromise the eventual functional result.

The amount of admixture in nasal lavage fluids was determined by addition of 99mTc labelled albumin, providing a correction factor for measurements of cellular material and humoral substances in nasal lavage return as well as a quantitative measure of nasal secretions. 2. Albumin was chosen as marker molecule, since only negligible amounts were absorbed or adsorbed to the mucosa during the nasal lavage. 3. Labelling of the albumin with 99mTc ensured an accuracy of measurements only limited by the precision of the weighing. The isotope allowed for the determination of the amount of admixed secretion to be carried out on the whole sample of lavage fluid, thereby avoiding the necessity of complete admixture between marker and lavage fluid which would be pertinent to marker molecules measured chemically. The radiation from a nasal lavage is minimal and the procedure is fully acceptable for repeated use in humans. 4. The nasal lavage technique adopted allowed the return of 99.2% (median value) of the instilled volume. The area irrigated was visualized on a gamma-camera, and was demonstrated to cover an area larger than the area reached by challenge from a pumpspray, i.e. a large part of the nose, yet not the oropharynx. 5.

Eight patients (700 to 1400 g), all requiring mechanical ventilation with fraction of inspired oxygen greater than 0.6, were included in the trial; four were randomized to receive surfactant, and the others served as controls. Porcine surfactant (2 ml/kg; phospholipid concentration, 100 mg/ml) was instilled via a naso-endotracheal tube at end-expiration and dispersed into the lungs during a period of standardized \"sighing\" mediated by the ventilator: two prolonged ventilatory cycles (10 sec each) with an inspiration/expiration ratio of 4:1, followed by a 6-min ventilation with a frequency of 60 breath/min and an inspiration/expiration ratio of 4:1. Control babies received no surfactant but were otherwise subjected to the same ventilatory maneuvers. Surfactant-treated infants showed a rapid increase in transcutaneous oxygen associated with improved lung aeration in chest x-rays; the response was transient in three babies and persistent in one.

The relative risk for occupationally attributed asthma was elevated among industrial and agricultural workers as compared with white collar and service occupations. Analysis of disability benefit status did not indicate that this introduced major reporting bias in this survey. This study suggests that occupational factors may have a greater role in adult asthma than previously thought.', 'author': 'Blanc P.', 'source': 'Chest 8801; 92(4):613-7'}\n",

The overall data output between the three systems was comparable. However, minute ventilation was consistently higher on the Medical Graphics system, oxygen consumption was consistently lower on the Horizon system, and a technical error was discovered in the Medical Graphics system which resulted in a systematic overestimation of carbon dioxide production. Different methods of analyzing the data from the same test (60-s average, 15-s average, breath-by-breath, and 8-breath average) resulted in differences of up to 20 percent in the maximal values.

The physicians of patients in the oximeter group were at liberty to obtain arterial blood gas determinations during the study if they desired.

Somatostatin was infused at progressively increasing rates of 0.05, 0.15, 0.45, and 1.35 micrograms/kg/hr, for 30 min/dose, during pancreatic stimulation with secretin, 25 ng/kg/hr, and cerulein, 10 ng/kg/hr. Somatostatin, at the dose of 0.05 microgram/kg/hr (shown to produce blood levels similar to those measured after a meal) did not affect pancreatic secretion in any of the subjects. The successive three higher doses caused a significant and dose-dependent inhibition of protein concentration and output and of bicarbonate output. Bicarbonate concentration was slightly but significantly reduced only by the two highest doses of somatostatin. At each dose level, the inhibition of protein output was much more marked than the inhibition of bicarbonate output. The maximal inhibition of protein output (at 1.35 micrograms/kg/hr somatostatin) was 73.9 +/- 5.4%, and that of bicarbonate output was 55.9 +/- 6.4%. The results demonstrate that: (1) the administration of somatostatin at a low dose level does not affect human exocrine pancreatic secretion, at least under the experimental conditions of this study; and (2) the administration of larger doses of somatostatin inhibits pancreatic secretion of both protein and bicarbonate dose-dependently.

The latency of LES relaxation was increased substantially by pirenzepine and atropine, increased slightly by hexamethonium, but was not affected by 4-DAMP or 5-Meo-DMT. Given as concurrent intravenous infusions, hexamethonium, 5-Meo-DMT and 4-DAMP added to pirenzepine or atropine did not significantly increase LES relaxation latency above that caused by pirenzepine or atropine alone. None of the antagonists alone had a significant effect on percent LES relaxation. The combination of pirenzepine or 4-DAMP with hexamethonium and 5-Meo-DMT did not affect percent LES relaxation.

Using [19-3H3]androstenedione, we found that the surplus activity of 19-hydroxylase relative to aromatase was independent of age, sex, and androgen substrate concentration, despite 100-fold differences in tissue aromatase activity during the course of development. In addition, the surplus 19-hydroxylation was not affected by several agents which otherwise decreased or increased the activity of the aromatase enzyme, including metyrapone, KCN, and cytochrome P-450 reductase, the latter indicating that the failure of the 19-hydroxylated products to proceed to aromatization was not due to a deficit of reducing equivalents. 19-Hydroxylation of androgens in the rat brain is a quantitatively significant metabolic pathway in this tissue, although present data do not confirm the existence of a steroid C-19 hydroxylase in the brain separate from that involved in aromatization.', 'author': 'Michnovicz JJ; Hahn EF; Fishman J.', 'source': 'Endocrinology 8801; 121(4):1209-14'}\n",

Thus, a protein with its galactose residues covered or removed exhibits a far longer half life in plasma than one with its galactose residues exposed. The free alpha-subunit of human CG (hCG) has been shown to have a different carbohydrate composition than does the alpha-subunit dissociated from the intact hormone. In our laboratory, analysis of alpha-subunits isolated from pregnancy urine indicated that the alpha-subunit dissociated from hCG (hCG alpha) contains primarily monosialylated oligosaccharides, whereas the free alpha-subunit contains more than one sialic acid per oligosaccharide. This difference in the degree of sialylation prompted us to examine the clearance rates of these two subunits. Accordingly, free alpha and hCG alpha were purified by affinity chromatography and labeled with 125I. The labeled subunits were injected iv into rats and serum samples were removed at various time intervals over a 2-h period. The amount of [125I]alpha-subunit remaining in the serum was determined by immunoprecipitation using an antiserum to hCG alpha. The disappearance curves for the two subunits were indistinguishable and could be analyzed by a biexponential model. The t 1/2 of the faster component was 5 min, while the t 1/2 of the slower component was 74 min. In order to determine whether or not terminal galactose was present on either the hCG alpha or the free alpha-subunit, the labeled molecules were subjected to lectin column chromatography using Ricin or peanut lectin linked to agarose. Both of these lectins bind galactose but have different specificities with respect to the penultimate sugar. Both subunit preparations contained only minor amounts of material which could bind or either lectin. However, after desialylation, both hCG alpha and free alpha bound extensively to Ricin, indicating the presence of penultimate galactose residues in both. We conclude that terminal galactose residues are not present on the oligosaccharides of either hCG alpha or free alpha-subunits, and that the difference observed in the sialic acid contents of the two subunits does not affect their rates of clearance.', 'author': 'Blithe DL; Nisula BC.', 'source': 'Endocrinology 8801; 121(4):1215-20'}\n",

Compared to controls, Adx animals had a 75 +/- 0.5% (n = 30) reduction in pancreatic amylase content; a 50% decrease occurred within 1 day and the maximal 75% decrease was observed after 5 days.

Furthermore, in all Adx rats, pancreatic content of amylase and plasma B concentration was significantly correlated (r = 0.81, n = 30). The effect of adrenalectomy was selective for amylase; contents of ribonuclease, chymotrypsin, and elastase were not altered. However, the effects of high B replacement were not selective, and increased the content of all digestive enzymes. To determine whether the changes in enzyme content were associated with changes in messenger RNA (mRNA), pancreatic RNA was probed with 32P-labeled complementary DNAs for amylase, ribonuclease, and chymotrypsin. After adrenalectomy and B replacement there was a significant correlation only between amylase mRNA (r = 0.87, n = 13) and plasma B concentration.

To examine this possibility, the conversion of [3H]P5 to [3H]P4 was determined by the constant infusion method on day 100 (midgestation) and day 175 (near term) of gestation in baboons that received MER-25 (25 mg/day X kg BW, po) on days 95-100 or 140-175 (term = 184 days).

Radiolabeled progestins were purified from blood samples withdrawn from saphenous, uterine, and umbilical vessels, and the MCR of P4 and P5, uterine extraction of P5, and transfer constants (rho) for the peripheral, transuterofetoplacental, and transuteroplacental conversion of P5 to P4 were determined. The formation of P4 from P5 by incubates of placental cells obtained on day 175 from untreated and MER-25-treated baboons was also assessed. During normal baboon pregnancy the mean (+/- SE) % P5 extracted (i.e. metabolized) by the uterus was 31.0 +/- 3.3 at midgestation and 45.7 +/- 5.6 late in gestation. Peripheral and transuterofetoplacental rho values of P5 to P4 in untreated baboons were 6.9 +/- 1.8% and 37.3 +/- 7.9%, respectively, at midgestation and 6.1 +/- 0.6% and 46.8 +/- 10.1%, respectively, near term. The transuteroplacental rho of P5 to P4 was only slightly lower than the transuterofetoplacental values, indicating minimal conversion of P5 to P4 by the fetus.

The iodide uptake response to TSH was inhibited by the presence of human serum in a dose-dependent fashion, but pretreatment of serum with 10% polyethylene glycol restored TSH activity. The iodide uptake response was compared to the stimulation of cAMP production in the measurement of serum TSH bioactivity from human samples after immunoaffinity purification. In the cAMP production bioassay, immunoaffinity-purified serum TSH showed increased bioactivity in patients with primary hypothyroidism and TSH-secreting pituitary tumor compared to that in normal subjects, while in the iodide uptake bioassay minimal differences were detected among the different groups. To investigate further structure-function relationships of TSH in FRTL-5 cells we studied the effects of deglycosylated purified pituitary bovine and human TSH on both bioassays. Using two new enzymes, peptide-N-glycosidase and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F, we removed one carbohydrate chain from TSH alpha and all three chains from TSH, respectively. In the iodide uptake bioassay both enzymes induced a 2-fold decrease in TSH biopotency, while in the cAMP production bioassay this decrease was only present with peptide-N-glycosidase-treated TSH. In summary, 1) the iodide uptake bioassay system in FRTL-5 cells represents a valid and sensitive method for the measurement of TSH bioactivity from different sources and can be applied to serum samples with elevated TSH concentrations by simple pretreatment with polyethylene glycol without immunoaffinity purification; 2) the enzymatic removal of one carbohydrate chain from both bovine and human TSH significantly decrease their biological activity, assessed as cAMP production and iodide uptake response in FRTL-5 cells, while the removal of three carbohydrate chains induces a significant decrease only in the iodide uptake bioassay: and 3) the disparate results for cAMP and iodide uptake in both human samples and deglycosylated pituitary TSH suggest that in addition to cAMP, other second messengers may play a role in TSH action.', 'author': 'Nissim M; Lee KO; Petrick PA; Dahlberg PA; Weintraub BD.', 'source': 'Endocrinology 8801; 121(4):1278-87'}\n",

The second component (type II) demonstrates a high number of sites (Bmax = 164 fmol/mg protein) and low E2-binding affinity (Kd = 22.3 nM). The type I and type II E2-binding components were shown to sediment on sucrose gradients at 9.6S and 4.5S, respectively, and to focus at isoelectric points of 6.6 and 8.0, respectively. The addition of 0.4 M KCl to the homogenization buffer converted the high affinity receptor species to a form that cosedimented and cofocused with the low affinity E2-binding protein. When tumors were grown in intact male rats, the ratio of the type II to the type I protein, as assessed by sucrose gradient analysis, increased 4.5-fold relative to that in tumors from intact females. Concomitantly, the Kd values of the type I and type II proteins were increased 9- and 2-fold, respectively, and the Bmax of the type I protein was decreased.

Relative to that in intact females, tumor growth was retarded in intact male rats, but was unaffected by ovariectomy or castration. These studies demonstrate that the presence of the low affinity E2-binding protein does not necessarily predict E2 responsiveness. While the role of the type II cytosolic protein has not yet been established, it is possible that it could act as a reservoir for E2, which is required to activate specific biochemical functions such as progesterone receptor synthesis.

Angiotensinogen mRNA was detected at low levels in embryo bodies and yolk sac placenta from day 11 of gestation. An initial rise in the level was noted on day 13, reaching a plateau from day 17 of gestation to birth. Angiotensinogen mRNA levels of the embryonic head were about 10-fold less than those of the body on days 17-19 and increased to levels similar to those of the body on days 20-21.

Angiotensinogen mRNA from both embryos and yolk sac placenta was larger by about 200 bases than the mRNA obtained from adult rat liver; this was shown to be a consequence of both the utilization of more distal polyadenylation sites and a longer poly(A) tract.

It took more than 2 weeks after cessation of 2-4 weeks of treatment before 5-day vaginal cycles reappeared. Ovarian weights increased rapidly resulting from the accumulation of large numbers of corpora lutea. In addition, the ovaries developed occasional follicular cysts which could reach an extremely large size (2 mm or more). Analysis of serial histological sections of ovaries, combined with plasma concentrations of estradiol-17 beta and progesterone, indicated cyclic ovulation and corpus luteum formation together with persistence of functional activity of already existing and newly formed corpora lutea. RU486 seems to have the unique property of dissociating cessation of luteal activity and ovulation in rats. After treatment with RU486, pituitary enlargement and mammary gland alveolar development were observed. It is hypothesized that these effects result from unopposed estrogen action on PRL secretion.

When the endogenous concentration of pregnenolone was increased by inhibiting its further metabolism, P-450scc activity was reduced by 80% in unstimulated cultures and was completely eliminated in cAMP-treated cultures. These losses were prevented when cells were maintained at 1% O2. The amount of immunoreactive P-450scc was also decreased by treatments that reduced P-450scc activity. Stimulation with cAMP also lowered microsomal C17-20 lyase activity by an oxygen-mediated, steroid synthesis-dependent mechanism. Treatment of cultures with testosterone caused a similar oxygen tension-sensitive decrease in C17-20 lyase activity. These results suggest that the enhanced loss of mitochondrial and microsomal cytochrome P-450 activities in cAMP-treated cultures is caused by the increased production of pregnenolone and testosterone, respectively, which generate reactive damaging species derived from reduced dioxygen. The increased catalytic turnover of these P-450 enzymes may also contribute to their damage.

In contrast the rat type I binds with higher affinity to B (Kd, 0.9 nM) than to F (Kd, 2.2 nM). The hamster type II binds to F with much higher affinity (Kd, 2.9 nM) than does the rat type II to F (Kd, 20.1 nM).

Additionally, the stimulation of cAMP synthesis by a glucagon fragment (glucagon) in transformed-induced cells was greatly reduced compared to normal cells. The adenylate cyclase regulatory components of transformed-induced MDCK cell membranes seemed unaltered compared to the parental line. Both contained equivalent amounts of cholera and pertussis toxin substrates, and soluble extracts were equally capable of reconstituting isoproterenol responsiveness of S49 cyc- membranes. However, membrane fusion studies demonstrated that the glucagon sensitivity of transformed-induced membranes could not be reconstituted with heterologous membranes. When donor transformed-induced membranes (with inactivated adenylate cyclase) were fused with acceptor HeLa membranes (normally unresponsive to glucagon and prostaglandin E), such hybrids were unresponsive to glucagon, although responsiveness to prostaglandin E was evident. Parallel hybrids with normal MDCK membranes were responsive to both glucagon and prostaglandin E. This difference could not be explained by an inhibitory effect of transformed-induced membranes on receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling under the fusion conditions: the ability of these membranes to serve as an acceptor for the reconstitution of vasoactive intestinal peptide responsiveness was identical to that of normal MDCK cells. The data suggest that the glucagon sensitivity induced in transformed MDCK cells differs significantly from that of the parental line. However, these differences cannot be explained by alterations of transformed-induced membrane components relevant to the coupling of hormone receptors to adenylate cyclase.', 'author': 'Beckner SK; Wright DE; Lin MC.', 'source': 'Endocrinology 8801; 121(4):1438-46'}\n",

We show that membranes from newly differentiated chick embryo tissues (day 6 brain, day 6 heart, day 8 liver, day 12 skeletal muscle) as well as whole embryos postneurulation (day 2, stage of 27-30 somites) have two populations of receptors with distinct specificity: insulin and type I IGF (IGF-I) receptors. Both insulin and IGF-I alpha-subunits, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, had tissue-dependent heterogeneity in Mr (liver greater than heart = skeletal muscle greater than brain) ranging from 138 kilodaltons (kDa) to 129 kDa. Desialylation of the receptors by treatment with neuraminidase produced a significant change in the Mr of the alpha-subunits in liver and heart but not in brain or the whole day 2 embryo. In each tissue the pattern for insulin receptors and IGF-I receptors was strikingly similar. Our studies raise the possibility that postranslational modifications of the insulin and IGF-I receptors, characteristic of terminally differentiated tissues, are already present in early organogenesis. Further, structural heterogeneity of the binding subunit of these receptors among tissues appears to be widespread and not exclusive to the brain receptor. An insulin receptor with features similar to the neural type is the only one detected in embryos at the beginning of organogenesis (day 2). The functional implication of this developmental tissue-specific regulation of insulin and IGF-I receptors, is still speculative. Its possible importance is suggested by the fact that it occurs embryologically early and affects both insulin and IGF-I receptors in parallel.', 'author': 'Bassas L; de Pablo F; Lesniak MA; Roth J.', 'source': 'Endocrinology 8801; 121(4):1468-76'}\n",

In the presence of hPRL, the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), known to activate the Na+/H+ antiporter as well as protein kinase C in other cell systems, enhanced the hPRL-stimulated Nb2 cell mitogenesis.

From 25-100 nM TPA, the increase in the rate of H+ efflux was detectable by 3 min, reached a maximum by 15 min, and was sustained 30 min after the addition of TPA. The TPA-stimulated H+ efflux was dependent on extracellular Na+ and was almost completely inhibited after a 10 min preincubation with 25 microM EP-Am. TPA also increased the intracellular pH (pHi) of stationary cultures of Nb2 cells from 7.29 +/- 0.02 (n = 8) to a maximum of 7.45 +/- 0.03 (n = 10).

A preincubation with EP-Am (25 microM) for 5-10 min abolished the TPA-induced increase in pHi whereas prolonged incubation with H-7 (50 microM) for up to 3 h was required to decrease the stimulatory effect of TPA by approximately 50%. Although activation of the Na+/H+ exchange system is clearly an early consequence of the action of TPA on Nb2 cells, the failure of TPA to stimulate Nb2 cell proliferation suggests that stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange and protein kinase C activity are not sufficient to generate a mitogenic response in these cells.', 'author': 'Too CK; Walker A; Murphy PR; Cragoe EJ Jr; Jacobs HK; Friesen HG.', 'source': 'Endocrinology 8801; 121(4):1503-11'}\n",

From 5-100 ng/ml, the hPRL-induced increase in H+ efflux rate was measurable by 3 min and reached a dose-dependent maximum by 15 min. A higher final H+ efflux rate was achieved with a higher concentration of hPRL. Complete replacement of Na+ by choline chloride gave a marginal increase in the rate of H+ efflux upon addition of hPRL.

One minute after the addition of hPRL (5 ng/ml), there was a significant increase in (P less than 0.01) 22Na+ uptake over the hormonally untreated controls. Addition of hPRL (5 and 10 ng/ml) to Nb2 cells induced a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in pHi within 4 min, while with a higher concentration of 30 ng/ml the increase was significant by 1 min.

These classic target cells for GH have been shown to process GH through two pathways: a nondegradative pathway which resulted in the rapid release of intact GH, and a slower, degradative pathway which involved the degradation of GH and release of degraded ligand. Differentiation between the two pathways was on the basis of differences in their kinetics and temperature dependence. The present study has investigated the relative characteristics of the two pathways further. Incubation of [125I]human GH ([125I]hGH)-preloaded adipocytes with extracellular unlabeled hGH (400 ng/ml) resulted in an increase in the absolute amount of [125I]hGH released. The increased amount of [125I]hGH released was all intact. Extracellular, unlabeled hGH had no effect on the rate or amount of degraded [125I]hGH released. This suggests that the nondegradative pathway is sensitive to the number of internalized hormone-receptor complexes and that GH which is not immediately degraded or stored in the degradative pathway, is redirected and processed via the faster non-degradative pathway. Ammonium chloride (known to inhibit the lysosomal degradation of many polypeptide hormones) markedly inhibited the absolute amount of [125I]hGH released from preloaded adipocytes. This inhibition was due to an effect on the release of degraded [125I]hGH. NH4Cl had no effect on the rate or amount of intact [125I]hGH released. Finally, it was found that dinitrophenol and sodium fluoride (agents known to deplete cellular energy) inhibited the release of degraded GH but not intact GH suggesting that the degradative pathway involves an energy-dependent step, most likely the fusion of hormone-containing vesicles with the lysosomal membrane. The mechanism of release of intact hormone by energy-independent means is not yet known. These data indicate that the processing of GH by cultured rat adipocytes is complex and involves at least two independently regulated pathways, a predominant degradative route and a nondegradative route. Further studies are required to assess the possible roles of these pathways in the metabolic actions of GH in adipocytes.', 'author': 'Roupas P; Herington AC.', 'source': 'Endocrinology 8801; 121(4):1521-30'}\n",

To examine this issue rats were administered ACTH or corticosterone or subjected to adrenalectomy, and the quantity of peripherally directed transported SP was measured in those animals as an indication of neuropeptide synthesis. ACTH treatment (12 U/day, sc, for 14 days) resulted in significant adrenal hypertrophy and increased corticosterone levels. The 24-h accumulation of SP proximal to ligature in the cervical vagus was significantly reduced [mean net proximal segment content: controls, 529 +/- 42 (+/- SEM) pg/3 mm segment; ACTH, 282 +/- 44]. The content in the unligated nerve, one sixth or less than that proximal to ligature, was not different in the two groups. In a separate experiment, ACTH (6 U/day for 14 days) had no effect compared to controls, whereas 16 U/day reduced transported SP. The content in the unligated nerve was again not different in the two groups. In the same experiment, corticosterone (2.5 mg/100 g BW, sc, for 14 days) reduced the quantity of transported SP. Total protein content in proximal segments was reduced only in the corticosterone group and was identical in all groups in unligated nerve. Adrenalectomy modestly increased transport by 20% and contralateral unligated nerve content by a similar percentage. The quantity of transported somatostatin, another vagal neuropeptide partly derived from sensory cell bodies, was either increased or unaltered by the experimental manipulations. In summary, these studies demonstrate that the chronic administration of ACTH or corticosterone significantly decreases the quantity of peripherally transported SP in the sensory vagus nerve and, presumably, synthesis within the vagal sensory ganglia.

A discrete and characteristic distribution of insulin receptor binding was demonstrated, with specific binding representing 92% of total binding. Displacement and specificity competition curves in olfactory bulb are typical for authentic insulin receptors, and computer analysis indicates a single class of binding site with a dissociation constant (Kd) 0.48 nM for choroid plexus and 0.44 nM for olfactory bulb external plexiform layer. Insulin receptor density is maximum in the choroid plexus, and high in the external plexiform layer of olfactory bulb. Structures of the limbic system and hypothalamus reveal moderate to high insulin receptor density, particularly the lateral septum, amygdala, subiculum, hippocampal CA1 region, mammillary body, and arcuate nucleus. Moderate insulin receptor density occurs in regions of cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and moderate to low binding occurs in discrete brainstem and midbrain structures. Insulin binding in the pituitary gland is greatest in the anterior lobe, with clear distinction from intermediate and posterior lobes. The circumventricular organs and the thalamus show low insulin binding. We conclude that insulin receptors are widespread throughout rat brain, with concentration in regions concerned with olfaction, appetite, and autonomic functions. The distribution is distinct from other neuropeptides and not related to either vascularity or cell density. A common feature of regions rich in insulin receptors is that they contain dendritic fields receiving rich synaptic input.

The clinical, CT scan, and other investigatory findings suggest that the seizures may occasionally cause a CT-demonstrable focal abnormality, probably cerebral edema, a consequence of abnormal vascular permeability.

Compared to RT and NC groups, the LT patients manifested poorer verbal learning ability, impaired immediate memory, and increased difficulty in the retrieval of verbal material from memory store.

However, the trophoblast eventually erodes into vessels and a variable degree of bleeding and hematoma compromises its growth. The serum beta-hCG level then usually begins to demonstrate some degree of abnormal progression. For our patients, the length of the ectopic pregnancy varied widely, depending mainly on when the individual patient chose to seek medical treatment. Infertility patients followed from the moment of conception would thus be expected to show a better correlation between early beta-hCG levels and the size of the tubal pregnancy. Preconditions for the operative laparoscopic management of a tubal pregnancy usually include that the tube be unruptured, less than 3 cm in diameter, and readily accessible via the laparoscopic approach. Ackerman et al. suggested there was a general correlation between the serum beta-hCG level and tubal rupture, and the present data demonstrate an overall positive correlation between the size of the tubal pregnancy and the serum level. However, the range of levels is so broad for any given size of mass or tubal status that this correlation is not meaningful clinically.

During stepwise reductions in perfusion pressure, oxygen consumption was relatively constant and blood flow-independent over most of the pressure range.

These data confirm and extend animal studies of ileal bile salt transport. Taurocholate uptake by the human ileal brush border occurs by a Na+-dependent, carrier-mediated electroneutral mechanism. According to this model, a single Na ion is coupled with a single taurocholate anion and transported across the brush border by a carrier mechanism that is driven by a transmembrane Na+ gradient.', 'author': 'Barnard JA; Ghishan FK.', 'source': 'Gastroenterology 8801; 93(5):925-33'}\n",

Stool weights and frequencies were higher in patients with active colitis than in patients with quiescent disease. Patients with active colitis also passed smaller amounts of stool during each bowel movement, suggesting that they experienced a desire to defecate at lower rectal volumes.

In the dogs with aerobic overgrowth, there was a selective loss of brush border alkaline phosphatase activity, and gamma-glutamyl transferase activity was increased, whereas activities of disaccharidases and aminopeptidase N were unaltered. In contrast, anaerobic overgrowth was associated with a reduction in brush border density, indicative of a considerable fall in the glycoprotein-to-lipid ratio of the brush border membrane, whereas brush border enzyme activities were unaltered. There was a loss of peroxisomal catalase activity in dogs with aerobic overgrowth, and an indication of mitochondrial disruption in dogs with anaerobic overgrowth, but little evidence for damage to other subcellular organelles.

Gastrin-releasing peptide elevated postprandial plasma gastrin during vagal blockade to levels comparable to those with the vagus intact but did not alter the nadir plasma somatostatin response. The plasma gastrin and somatostatin rises associated with insulin hypoglycemia were similarly inhibited by cooling to -2 degrees C. Cooling to 12 degrees C, which selectively blocks vagal inhibitory pathways, had no effect on meal-stimulated gastrin release and partially decreased the plasma gastrin response to insulin hypoglycemia.

We examined the influence of serotonin and cisapride on ion transport across intestinal mucosa in vitro and studied the effect of cisapride on the response to serotonin. Segments of ileum of male Sprague-Dawley rats were stripped of muscle layers and mounted in flux chambers. The addition of serotonin (10(-8) to 10(-4) M) to the serosal aspect of the mucosa caused a rapid, dose-dependent rise in short circuit current and transmural potential difference. Cisapride alone (5 X 10(-5) M), when added to the mucosal and serosal surfaces, had no effect on the short circuit current, transmural potential difference, resistance, or sodium and chloride fluxes across the mucosa. It did, however, inhibit the response of the mucosa to serotonin (10(-5) M) in a dose dependent manner and blocked it completely at a concentration of 5 X 10(-5) M. Serotonin (5 X 10(-5) M) increased serosal to mucosal flux of chloride from 12.6 +/- 0.8 to 15.2 +/- 0.6 mumol/cm2/h (p less than 0.025), thus reducing net chloride absorption from 4.65 +/- 0.81 to 1.49 +/- 1.04 mumol/cm2/h (p less than 0.05).

Changes in pH had little effect on the extent of inhibition by indocyanine green. However, inhibition by bilirubin, biliverdin and chenodeoxycholic acid was found to be pH-dependent, with markedly less inhibition at the high values of pH. The reduced inhibition at the high values of pH could not be ascribed to a failure of the enzyme to bind the nonsubstrate ligand. Instead, the complete inhibition observed at pH 6.5 became partial (hyperbolic) inhibition at pH 9.1. This behavior can be ascribed to the binding of the nonsubstrate ligands at a site other than the active site, i.e., at high values of pH there is formation of an enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex which still retains considerable catalytic activity. At physiologic values of pH (7.0), the human transferase was completely inhibited by saturating concentrations of the tested nonsubstrate ligands. This is in contrast to our previous studies performed with the rat transferases where, although inhibition also was affected by buffer pH, some forms of the enzyme retained significant catalytic activity at pH 7.0 despite high concentrations of nonsubstrate ligands. We conclude that the ability of the human cationic glutathione S-transferases to serve as enzymes of detoxification in the presence of high intracellular concentrations of nonsubstrate ligands may be significantly reduced, and this may render the cholestatic liver unusually susceptible to injury by toxic electrophiles.', 'author': 'Boyer TD; Vessey DA.', 'source': 'Hepatology 8801; 7(5):843-8'}\n",

Ten minutes after injection in an antegrade perfusion, 95% of the dose was localized in the portal half of the acinus. Fifty minutes later, however, the amount of rhodamine B in Zone 1 had been reduced to 23%; 30 and 31% were in Zones 2 and 3, respectively, and the medium concentration was doubled. Thus, unchanged rhodamine B appeared to be transported downstream within the liver, either via the medium or directly from cell to cell, finally resulting in a relatively higher rhodamine B concentration in Zone 3. To obtain additional data, we designed a perfusion setup in which the zones could be studied separately. In both zones, the amount excreted into the medium was about 30 times the amount excreted into bile. Intracellular sequestration of rhodamine B and the rate constant for sinusoidal secretion were higher in Zone 3, while the sinusoidal uptake rates were equal; biliary excretion was higher in Zone 1. Acinar distribution changed with time because rhodamine B, primarily accumulated in Zone 1, was secreted into the sinusoids and taken up again by downstream cells.

To test this hypothesis, sera were collected from 22 patients with alcoholic hepatitis and 9 normal controls, and evaluated for the antigenic presence of chemotactic factor inactivator using an ELISA test.

An amount of 19.7 +/- 3.6% (mean +/- S.D., n = 6) of the total serum bile salts was found in the high-density lipoprotein fraction of the density gradient. 2. In sera of nonicteric patients, the distribution pattern of [3H]taurocholate in the fractions of the density gradient showed no essential differences to normal serum. The relative amounts of taurocholate in the albumin-containing fractions and the high-density lipoprotein fractions were dependent on the concentrations of albumin and high-density lipoprotein. 3. In sera of deeply jaundiced patients, the distribution pattern of [3H]taurocholate showed two distinct peaks in the high-density lipoprotein density range, one of which codistributed with high-density lipoprotein2 and the other with a high-density fraction of high-density lipoprotein3 in the density range of 1.19 to 1.23 gm per ml. The distribution of [3H]taurocholate between albumin and high-density lipoprotein was markedly shifted toward high-density lipoprotein. No [3H]taurocholate association with lipoprotein X was observed. 4. Bilirubin was found to cause a shift of taurocholate from albumin to high-density lipoprotein in vitro.

Serial studies in acute hepatitis showed evidence of antibodies early in the course of illness with disappearance prior to full recovery. In acute hepatitis B, the presence of polyalbumin antibodies was significantly associated with female sex (p less than 0.01), 3-fold higher transaminase levels and shorter duration of clinical illness (less than 4 weeks in all cases). Polyalbumin antibodies appear to be associated with diseases characterized by active hepatocyte necrosis.

In general, hepatic involvement represented part of a previously diagnosed, widely disseminated disease process, and liver biopsy led to new AIDS-specific diagnoses in only two patients.

Calcium supplementation significantly attenuated the development of hypertension (systolic blood pressure: 183 +/- 8 vs 130 +/- 2 mm Hg) and was found to abate existing renovascular hypertension (systolic blood pressure: from 183 +/- 8 to 151 +/- 4 mm Hg). Calcium treatment did not cause significant alterations in fluid intake, urine volume, or urinary sodium excretion in either study. However, increased plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration were suppressed to the basal levels at the end of 3 weeks of calcium treatment (14 +/- 3 vs 8 +/- 2 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr; 530 +/- 50 vs 380 +/- 40 pg/ml). Blood pressure of calcium-treated renovascular hypertensive rats responded poorly to blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with captopril injection and angiotensin II analogue (saralasin) infusion. Further, in rats with chronic established renovascular hypertension, calcium treatment attenuated the enhanced pressor response to norepinephrine, but not to angiotensin II.

An effect of vasopressin on ganglionic transmission was excluded, since the sympathoexcitatory response to apnea was not attenuated during vasopressin. Thus, pathophysiologic levels of vasopressin in humans cause inhibition of muscle sympathetic nerve activity that is not due to a ganglionic blocking action. The sympathoinhibition may be caused in part by the modest increases in mean arterial and central venous pressures and attendant stimulation of arterial and cardiac baroreceptors.

The median ratios of 24-hour to 8-hour overnight excretion were 2.84, 3.95, 2.99, and 2.77 for sodium, potassium, creatinine, and water, respectively.

When the group was subdivided based on age, sex, race, trial randomization group, use of diuretics, and hypertension severity, women had significantly lower ratios of 24-hour to overnight excretion for sodium and water than men and blacks had significantly lower 24-hour to overnight ratios for water and potassium than whites.

We found that under hyperoxic conditions 1) the incorporation of [3H]-uridine into total and polyadenylated RNA was increased, 2) the efficiency of extracted messenger RNA to direct protein synthesis in a reticulocyte lysate was maintained, 3) the proportion of polymeric to monomeric ribosomes was slightly increased, and 4) the rate of elongation, as measured by the ribosomal transit time, was decreased. Thus the reduction in protein synthesis in hyperoxic cells appears to result primarily from defects at the translational level in polypeptide chain elongation.', 'author': 'Jornot L; Mirault ME; Junod AF.', 'source': 'J Appl Physiol 8801; 63(2):457-64'}\n",

We measured upstream element for driving pressure for systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation by raising pulmonary venous pressure (Ppv) until the systemic to pulmonary flow from bronchial circulation ceased. We assumed that this was the same as upstream pressure when there was flow.

First, halothane anesthesia does not modify pulmonary ventilation, but a tachypnea much more intense in intact than in decerebrated cats is observed. This indicates that halothane-induced tachypnea originates mainly in structures rostral to the brain stem. Second, decerebrated animals exhibit a breathing pattern and a ventilatory response to CO2 similar to those of intact conscious cats, suggesting that forebrain facilitatory and inhibitory influences on brain stem are cancelled out by decerebration.

At the earliest gestational age, diaphragmatic EMG activity was mainly tonic and associated with tonic activity of somatic muscles. The stimulus for the diaphragmatic activity originated centrally. Brief periods of a rapid-eye-movement (REM) state characterized by phasic lateral rectus and diaphragmatic activity and absence of nuchal activity were recognized. Furthermore, from 0.5 to 0.7 gestation onward, activity of all muscles increased. Thereafter increased specificity of activity in relation to the apparent REM and non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) state occurred. With maturation, phasic diaphragmatic activity increased at the expense of tonic activity. The most striking effect of maturation on apnea was a greater proportion of apnea lasting greater than 1 min, but the total duration of apnea as a percent of a total recording remained unchanged. The quantitative response to hypercapnia during maturation was independent of the pattern of spontaneous diaphragmatic activity. Hypercapnia at 0.5 gestation changed the pattern of diaphragmatic EMG activity from mainly tonic to phasic. Thus the central chemoreceptors and appropriate neuronal pathways are present and functional as early as 0.5 gestation. Hypercapnia at 0.5 gestation caused a shift in diaphragmatic EMG power to lower frequencies similar to that found during control conditions in the older fetus. This might suggest that during maturation there is increased recruitment of phrenic motoneurons. Hypoxemia abolished tonic somatic activity at 0.5 gestation and decreased phasic diaphragmatic activity at more advanced gestational ages. Therefore the central inhibitory mechanisms of hypoxemia are developed by 0.5 gestation.', 'author': 'Ioffe S; Jansen AH; Chernick V.', 'source': 'J Appl Physiol 8801; 63(2):609-22'}\n",

In this fashion a limited mapping of skin-mediated bronchoconstriction was established. Warm packs were applied to the same areas of control for any potential nonspecific stimulatory effects. Cooling the skin induced bronchoconstriction to a similar degree in both groups; this effect was very small, did not induce symptoms, and was only seen with stimulation of the face.

A moderate but significant correlation existed between skin and airway sensitivity; however, the magnitude of the two responses differed markedly.

As in the previous study, the trachea was modeled as a trough of rectangular cross section with only the bottom lined with the mucus simulant. Clearance was followed by observing the displacement of marker particles. Since cough clearance is intimately related to wave formation in the mucus blanket, we hypothesized that clearance might be impeded if the wave formation occurred simultaneously in the wall and its lining layer. Thus, in one set of experiments the bottom rigid surface of the model trachea was replaced with a frame over which a flexible membrane could be drawn, whereas in the other set the rigid top was replaced by the frame.

Receptors were stimulated by applying either capsaicin (10 micrograms) or bradykinin (500 ng) to the epicardial surface of the right ventricle in anesthetized cats. Application of either chemical evoked an increase in respiratory output (phrenic nerve activity), a decrease in heart rate, and a nonsignificant increase in arterial pressure in intact cats. However, capsaicin and bradykinin produced significant increases in arterial pressure, heart rate, and respiratory output after bilateral cervical vagotomy.

Only small responses to the chemical stimulation of right ventricular receptors persisted after combined vagotomy and stellate ganglionectomy.

We implanted markers in the LV to establish three perpendicular axes and recorded the motion of these markers using biplane cinefluoroscopy at 60 Hz. The primary changes in LV size that accompanied inspiration occurred at end diastole (ED). The largest change in LVED dimension was a 2.46-mm narrowing of the septal-lateral wall dimension, but the apex-base dimension decreased also, by 0.74 mm. The anteroposterior dimension actually widened by 1.07 mm. The septal-lateral narrowing was caused by both a 1.0-mm narrowing of the distance between the septal marker and the apex-base axis, as well as by a 1.4-mm narrowing between the apex-base axis and the lateral wall marker. Narrowing of the septal portion seemed expected because of presumed enhanced right ventricular filling during inspiration. Narrowing of the lateral portion of the LV, while the anteroposterior dimension widened, was surprising because a change in LVEDV shape is implied. Assuming ventricular homogeneity, this change in LVED shape implies that the forces applied to the epicardial surface were not uniform. There must have been a retraction on the anterior and posterior surface that was not experienced by the lateral LV wall. The net effect of these dimensional changes of the LV at end diastole (estimated from the product of the three ED axes) was a 3.5-cm3 reduction in LVED volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 'author': 'Cassidy SS; Wead WB; Seibert GB; Ramanathan M.', 'source': 'J Appl Physiol 8801; 63(2):803-11'}\n",

The order of potency of competitive beta-agonists was isoproterenol greater than norepinephrine greater than epinephrine.

Similar reductions in arterial pressure did not affect force production in caudofemoralis, which contains mainly fast-fatiguing fibers. In human subjects the electromyogram produced by the ankle extensors during rhythmic constant-force contractions increased as the contracting muscles were raised above the heart during legs-up tilt. This suggests that force production of active muscle fibers at a given level of activation fell with muscle perfusion pressure, thus requiring augmentation of muscle activity to sustain the standard contractions. Because aerobic fibers contributed to these contractions, it appears that force production of human muscle fibers is sensitive to small changes in perfusion pressure and, presumably, blood flow.

Radioactivity from labeled MS and RBC's was measured by external detection using a gamma camera. We defined six regions of interest in the image of the left lateral surface of the lung: a dorsocaudal, a caudal, two ventral, an apical, and a central region. In each lung, regional trapping of MS was measured from the image of radioactivity obtained after slow injection of a suspension of MS into the arterial perfusion tubing. A radioactive bolus of labeled RBC's was injected during rapid imaging of the lung to obtain radioactivity vs. time curves from each region. The peaks of the regional radioactivity vs. time curves were used to estimate regional flows, though compensation had to be made for overlap of the washout and washin phases of the bolus of labeled RBC's. The results indicated that there were no differences in the regional distribution of MS compared with the regional distribution of RBC flow in isolated, perfused dog lungs.\", 'author': 'Beck KC.', 'source': 'J Appl Physiol 8801; 63(2):883-9'}\n",

Exercise speeded transit of the liquid meal, with mean rises in H2 concentration taking place 66 +/- 10 min after ingestion at rest, compared with 44 +/- 6 min after food intake during exercise (P less than 0.02). H2 concentrations in the rebreathing apparatus showed similar base lines in the two experiments, and quantitative increases in H2 concentration, although shifted in time by exercise, were otherwise identical. Subjects with the slowest resting transit rates showed the largest exercise effects (r = 0.79, P less than 0.05).

During 2-h chamber exposures, subjects alternated between periods of rest and light exercise with hourly spirometric measurement of lung function. Mechanical and mucociliary function responses to ozone by lung airways appeared concentration dependent. Reduction in particle retention was significant (P less than 0.005) (i.e., transport of lung mucus was increased during exposure to 0.4 ppm ozone and was coincident with impaired lung function; e.g., forced vital capacity and midmaximal flow rate fell by 12 and 16%, respectively, and forced expiratory volume at 1 s by 5%, of preexposure values). Regional analysis indicated that mucus flow from distal airways into central bronchi was significantly increased (P less than 0.025) by 0.2 ppm ozone. This peripheral effect, however, was buffered by only a marginal influence of 0.2 ppm ozone on larger bronchi, such that the resultant mucus transport for all airways of the lung in aggregate differed only slightly from FA exposures. These data may reflect differences in regional diffusion of ozone along the respiratory tract, rather than tissue sensitivity. In conclusion, mucociliary function of humans is acutely stimulated by ozone and may result from fluid additions to the mucus layer from mucosal and submucosal secretory cells and/or alteration of epithelial permeability.', 'author': 'Foster WM; Costa DL; Langenback EG.', 'source': 'J Appl Physiol 8801; 63(3):996-1002'}\n",

A gait study of the knee and ankle.', 'publication_type': 'JOURNAL ARTICLE.', 'abstract': 'Findings from biomechanical analyses of gait were used to estimate the optimum position of arthrodesis of the ankle. Nineteen patients who were followed for an average of 10.4 years (range, four to seventeen years) were studied. By including the knee in the analysis as well as studying the effects on gait of different ground conditions, objective data for the weight-bearing extremities in the transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes were generated. Genu recurvatum was shown to be associated with a plantar-flexion position of fusion of the ankle. Laxity of the medial collateral ligament of the knee was noted in twelve patients (63 per cent). Among these patients, in three (16 per cent) the laxity was graded as moderate to severe, possibly due to external rotation of the extremity during gait to avoid rolling over the rigid plantar-flexed ankle. The patterns of gait showed that a valgus position of the arthrodesis is more advantageous and provides more normal gait, particularly on uneven ground. To attain more normal function of the knee and improve performance on rough ground, the optimum position of arthrodesis of the ankle appears to be neutral flexion, slight (zero to 5 degrees) valgus angulation, and approximately 5 to 10 degrees of external rotation. Posterior displacement of the talus under the tibia tends to produce a more normal pattern of gait and decreases the stress at the knee. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study has shown the ideal position of fusion of the ankle to be neutral flexion, slight (zero to 5 degrees) valgus angulation of the hind part of the foot, and 5 to 10 degrees of external rotation.

We measured the extent to which early antibiotic therapy with ceforanide altered the degradation of the cartilage after arthritis due to Staphylococcus aureus had been produced in the knee joint in rabbits. Degradation of the cartilage was quantified by analyses for glycosaminoglycan and collagen. Three weeks after the infection was produced, the cartilage had lost more than half of its glycosaminoglycan whether the antibiotic therapy had been started at one, two, or seven days after infection. Beginning the antibiotic treatment one day after infection reduced over-all loss of collagen by 37 per cent and decreased the area of erosion of the infected articular surfaces. When antibiotic treatment was begun at four, eight, or twelve hours after infection, the loss of glycosaminoglycan averaged 18 per cent. Prophylaxis with antibiotics completely prevented any degradation of the cartilage. Clinical relevance: The findings reported here show how rapidly cartilage loses glycosaminoglycan when it is involved by arthritis caused by staphylococci and how early treatment of the infection reduces the loss of collagen. There is less protection against loss of glycosaminoglycan.

An initial analysis was conducted on selected data gathered from 29 patients as part of a more comprehensive, prospective study of burn rehabilitation outcome. Measurements analyzed included the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), the Health-Specific Locus of Control Scale (HLC), and the total body surface area burned (TBSA). Findings showed that TBSA was related to the degree to which patients perceived they had control over their health, but few correlations were found between TBSA, and HLC scale, and the SIP scale. On the SIP, most patients reported few or no problems, but a significant minority reported major problems in one or more areas of their lives. The problems that were reported tended to cluster in the areas of vocation and emotional adjustment.

At implantation, silicone rubber grafts were overcompliant (15.0 +/- 1.1% radial change/mmHg X 10(-2); mean +/- S.E.) compared to the proximal artery (7.7 +/- .6%).

Specifically, in IH patients treated with spironolactone, serum testosterone, free testosterone, and androstenedione levels changed little, yet clinical improvement frequently occurred, and this improvement was reflected by concomitantly lowered 3 alpha-diol G levels. Further, in 4 IH patients, discontinuation of effective therapy resulted in prompt increases in serum 3 alpha-diol G as harbingers of worsening hair growth.

The IGF-I components isolated by HPLC were normally active in stimulating [3H] alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake by normal human fibroblasts.

In this study the presence of specific binding sites for synthetic salmon CT in intact human spermatozoa was investigated using [125I]salmon CT. Binding experiments demonstrated a CT-sperm interaction involving a receptor-mediated mechanism. The binding was very rapid and minimally reversible, with the maximal site saturation occurring at approximately 2 nM labeled peptide.

Increasing concentrations of unlabeled salmon, eel, and human CT produced a dose-dependent inhibition of [125I]salmon CT binding.

Because its specificity is similar to that of the GH receptor, we considered the possibility that it represented a circulating receptor subunit or fragment. Laron-type dwarfism is a rare disorder characterized by severe growth failure, resistance to GH, and GH receptor deficiency. To probe the relationship between the receptor and the circulating binding protein, we measured the binding of GH to plasma from a child with Laron-type dwarfism and compared it with that in plasma of normal children and adults. Normal plasma samples were supplemented with unlabeled GH to the endogenous GH level in the plasma of the Laron patient to yield comparable saturation of the BP. After incubation of plasma with radiolabeled GH, bound GH was separated from free GH by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. There was no detectable binding (less than 1.5%) of GH in the plasma of the Laron-type dwarf, whereas in normal children the bound GH fraction averaged 24.0 +/- 6.1% (mean +/- SD). Thus, the GH-BP is either absent or functionally abnormal in Laron-type dwarfism. This finding suggests that the circulating GH-BP is related to and/or may be derived from the GH receptor.

It is concluded that 2-hydroxybenzoylglycine plays an important role in drug binding defects observed in the newborn, and the inhibitor may also play a part in the precipitation of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity in neonates when the substance is abnormally elevated.', 'author': 'Suh B; Wadsworth SJ; Lichtenwalner DM.', 'source': 'J Clin Invest 8801; 80(4):1125-31'}\n",

The bolus-constant infusion technique produced a steady state in maternal plasma of immunoprecipitable label, measured using excess insulin or C-peptide antiserum. In animals infused with 125I-proinsulin, analysis of umbilical venous plasma revealed no apparent transfer to the fetus of immunoprecipitable label.

Gel filtration chromatography of umbilical venous plasma revealed that the immunoprecipitated moiety was a fragment of 125I-tyr-CP. Analysis of maternal plasma showed that the predominant peak of radioactivity represented intact C-peptide. A peak corresponding to the fetal immunoprecipitable peak was also present. Analysis of simultaneous maternal arterial and uterine vein plasma samples showed that degradation of 125I-tyr-CP occurred across the uterus. Studies in one nonpregnant and three postpartum animals indicated that pregnancy increased the rate of metabolism of 125I-tyr-CP. When 125I-tyr-CP was incubated with trophoblastic cells in culture, degradation to a species corresponding on gel filtration to the immunoprecipitable fetal metabolite was found.

These changes in PR and serum concentration of 1,25-(OH)2D could be mediated by changes in serum concentrations of phosphorus that occur after the morning fasting period. To examine this hypothesis, we measured serum concentrations of phosphorus in blood drawn at hourly intervals for 24 h in six healthy men in whom dietary phosphorus was initially maintained at 1,500 mg/70 kg body weight per day for 9 d, then restricted to 500 mg/d (coupled with orally administered aluminum hydroxide) for 10 d, and then supplemented to 3,000 mg/d for 10 d. When dietary phosphorus was normal, the serum concentration of phosphorus exhibited the normal circadian rhythm: a rapid decrease in early morning to a nadir at 1100, followed by an increase to plateau at 1600 h and a further increase to an acrophase (peak) at 0030 h. The variation in serum levels of phosphorus can be described as the sum of sinusoidal functions with periodicities of 24 and 12 h. Phosphorus restriction for 10 d induced a 40% reduction in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus, abolished the early afternoon rise in its serum level (i.e., the 12-h periodic component of the time series), and delayed the acrophase by 3 h to 0330 h. Phosphorus supplementation for 10 d induced a 14% increase in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus but no significant change in its morning fasting level, exaggerated the early afternoon rise in serum phosphorus, and advanced the acrophase by 9 h to 1530 h. The changes in the PR of 1,25-(OH)2D induced by restriction and supplementation of dietary phosphorus varied inversely and significantly with those induced in the 24-h mean serum level of phosphorus (R = -0.88, P less than 0.001).

By contrast, GRP peptide levels remain elevated until several months after birth. Consistent with this, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies showed that GRP mRNA and peptide consistently colocalized in early gestation lung but that in neonatal lung, many cells that contained GRP peptide no longer contained GRP mRNA.

Although these patients responded to high-dose prednisone therapy during the initial stages of acute disease, the addition of azathioprine failed to allow lower steroid doses and did not result in prolonged, complete remission. Indeed, the disease was exacerbated during azathioprine therapy, and significant side effects from prolonged high-dose steroid therapy were observed. Both clinical and serologic remission resulted from the addition of cyclophosphamide and dapsone to prednisone therapy. Thus, when azathioprine fails to produce remission or a steroid-sparing effect, cyclophosphamide may be an effective alternative. During a prolonged follow-up period, no recurrences of pemphigus have been observed, and no significant side effects of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) have been encountered. The addition of dapsone produced enhanced anti-inflammatory effects without increasing the existing or potential side effects of steroid therapy. Dapsone was easily withdrawn at the onset of remission. Thus the anti-inflammatory effect of dapsone may prove valuable in patients for whom steroids are contraindicated, who develop significant side effects during long-term steroid therapy, or for whom increases of dose threaten to enhance the possibility of catastrophic side effects.', 'author': 'Ahmed AR; Hombal S.', 'source': 'J Am Acad Dermatol 8801; 17(3):437-42'}\n",

Microscopically, the combined malformation contained narrow strands of basaloid cells and keratinous cysts in a desmoplastic stroma, intimately mixed with intradermal nests of nevocytes. Melanocytic nevi have been associated with epidermal hyperplasia resembling seborrheic keratoses, follicular cysts, trichostasis spinulosa, syringomas, basal cell carcinomas, and hair follicle formation on the soles.

In the present investigation, Doppler echocardiography was utilized to measure transmitral flow velocity and thereby assess left ventricular diastolic performance noninvasively in a group of 111 patients representative of the broad clinical spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, all Doppler indexes of diastolic relaxation and filling differed significantly (p less than 0.001) from those obtained in 86 control subjects without heart disease, namely, prolongation of isovolumic relaxation (94 +/- 24 versus 78 +/- 12 ms) and of the early diastolic peak of flow velocity (244 +/- 55 versus 220 +/- 28 ms), as well as slower deceleration (3.4 +/- 1.4 versus 4.9 +/- 1.3 m/s2) and reduced maximal flow velocity in early diastole (0.5 +/- 0.2 versus 0.6 +/- 0.1 m/s). As an apparent compensation for impaired relaxation and early diastolic filling, the atrial contribution to left ventricular filling was increased, as shown by increased late diastolic flow velocity (0.4 +/- 0.3 versus 0.3 +/- 0.1 m/s) and reduced ratio of maximal flow velocity in early diastole to that in late diastole (1.4 +/- 0.8 versus 2.1 +/- 0.9). The vast majority of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (91 [82%] of 111) showed evidence of impaired left ventricular diastolic performance, as assessed from the Doppler waveform. Abnormal Doppler diastolic indexes were identified with similar frequency in patients with (78%) or without (83%) left ventricular outflow obstruction, as well as in patients with (84%) or without (80%) cardiac symptoms. However, patients with nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed more severe alterations in the Doppler indexes of diastolic function than did patients with obstruction. Thus, abnormal diastolic performance as assessed by Doppler echocardiography was apparent in the vast majority of the study patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, independent of the presence or absence of cardiac symptoms or a subaortic pressure gradient. The high frequency with which diastolic abnormalities are identified in asymptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy suggests that impaired diastolic performance may be present at a time in the natural history of the disease when functional limitation is not yet evident.', 'author': 'Maron BJ; Spirito P; Green KJ; Wesley YE; Bonow RO; Arce J.', 'source': 'J Am Coll Cardiol 8801; 10(4):733-42'}\n",

Circular cross-sectional areas of the mitral anulus, aortic anulus and aortic bulbus were calculated from M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiographic diameters. The varying short axis of the elliptical mitral opening area was obtained from the diastolic leaflet separation in the M-mode, and the long axis was derived from the maximal mitral orifice area or mitral anulus diameter. Cardiac output was calculated by multiplying time-velocity integrals with the different areas and heart rate. Doppler flow measurements correlated significantly with the thermodilution method (r = 0.79 to 0.93). Flow measurements at the aortic anulus were most accurate (r = 0.93, SEE = 0.589 liter/min) if the annular area was derived from the M-mode tracing. Measurement of the anulus in the apical five chamber view yielded a significant underestimation and the area of the aortic bulbus provided an overestimation of cardiac output. Left ventricular inflow was underestimated at the mitral leaflet tips and overestimated at the mitral anulus. The accuracy of pulsed Doppler cardiac output measurements strongly depends on the assumed flow area and sampling site.

The purpose of this study was to define the mechanism of such retrodistribution of flow. In 24 anesthetized open chest dogs, Monastral blue dye (10 ml) was injected by way of a balloon catheter in the distal great cardiac vein as a marker for retrograde flow distribution. The injection rate (0.6 to 2.4 ml/s) was adjusted such that systolic pressure in the anterior interventricular vein ranged between 60 and 85 mm Hg. In 11 dogs with no ischemia and normal myocardial perfusion pressure (96 +/- 8 mm Hg), no myocardial staining occurred despite retrograde filling of epicardial veins. One minute after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, dye injections caused selective staining of the cyanotic area in 15 of 18 episodes, sparing the normal myocardium within the zone of retroperfused veins. In five dogs, with the arterial pressure less than 55 mm Hg, retroinjection resulted in homogeneous staining of all the myocardium drained by the retroperfused veins. Selective staining of the ischemic myocardium caused by retroinjection was associated with the following pressure gradients: during systole from the anterior interventricular vein to the occluded coronary artery, 31 to 58 mm Hg, and during diastole from the retroperfused veins to the left ventricular chamber, 9 to 28 mm Hg. There was no diastolic venoarterial gradient in the ischemic myocardium. In normal myocardium, retroinjection did not reverse the arteriovenous pressure gradient. In conclusion, retrograde flow is primarily directed to myocardium with low anterograde perfusion pressure. Selective retrograde penetration of acutely ischemic myocardium can thus be achieved by a mechanism consistent with the development of venoarterial and venoventricular pressure gradients.', 'author': 'Meesmann M; Karagueuzian HS; Ino T; McGrath MF; Fishbein MC; Mandel WJ; Peter T.', 'source': 'J Am Coll Cardiol 8801; 10(4):887-97'}\n",

Among obese children and adolescents, several problems have hindered the development of accurate clinical measures of percent body fat and total body fat. First, the use of direct methods to measure body composition is limited by expense and labor. Second, the relationship between anthropometric indexes and body composition in obese children and adolescents has not been intensively studied. Third, sample sizes of normal weight children have been too small to permit the development of diagnostic criteria. Fourth, the triceps skinfold is less reproducible in overweight subjects. Increases in lean body mass in obese adolescents may confound the use of the body mass index as a measure of adiposity.

During the same period, the purchase of red meat with separable fat (steaks, roasts, and chops) declined, while the purchase of red meat with hidden, non-separable fat (hamburger, lunch meats, sausage, and bacon) held constant or increased. Thus, two \"fat\" trends have been identified at the household level: first, the purchase of less red meat with separable fat and the discard of a greater percentage of that fat, and second, the purchase of a greater percentage of red meat with substantial quantities of non-separable fat. Whether these seemingly contradictory choices are being made by a fully informed public is unclear. It is suggested that health promoters need to communicate the fat content of all types of red meat, especially those with hidden fat, more clearly.', 'author': 'Rathje WL; Ho EE.', 'source': 'J Am Diet Assoc 8801; 87(10):1357-62'}\n",

It is the responsibility of nutrition educators to help consumers use those nutrient sources appropriately. Consumers should consider at least six factors when they select foods, supplements, and fortified foods: flavor, convenience, cost, nutrient content, toxic factors, and bioavailability of nutrients. Consumers are often less concerned about the latter two factors than they should be. For example, many case histories have been published on the symptoms caused by overconsumption of vitamins A, B-6, C, and D and nicotinic acid. Generally those toxic symptoms were caused by the ingestion of supplements, not foods. Current widespread use of supplements containing one or two nutrients may not only cause overt toxicity symptoms but also adversely affect the bioavailability of other nutrients. For example, ingestion of excessive amounts of vitamin C appears to interfere with copper metabolism in human subjects; ingestion of high levels of zinc impairs immune function, depresses copper absorption, and induces anemia; consumption of supplemental calcium as calcium phosphate dibasic is associated with renal calcification in rats; and ingestion of supplemental magnesium depresses the apparent absorption of calcium and retention of calcium in bone by rats.', 'author': 'Greger JL.', 'source': 'J Am Diet Assoc 8801; 87(10):1369-73'}\n",

We developed a protocol to enrich for NK cells in bone marrow and demonstrate that target binding can be used as a criterion for marrow NK cells if nonspecifically \"sticky\" cells are eliminated. The selected population of B cell-depleted bone marrow lymphoid cells was comprised mainly of lymphocytes, of which 80% were NK-1.1+. B cell-depleted bone marrow lymphocytes that bound to YAC-1 could be characterized as two populations on the basis of morphology and proliferative status: large, proliferating target-binding cells (TBC), of which 25% were in S phase of the mitotic cycle, and small postmitotic TBC. Pulse and chase studies indicated that the small TBC in bone marrow were derived from an immediate proliferating precursor, presumably the large TBC, which were, in turn, derived from a precursor population that was more rapidly proliferating. In contrast, few if any splenic TBC were labeled after a 30-min pulse with [3H]TdR and significant numbers of labeled TBC did not appear in the spleen until 2 or more days after the pulse label. Surprisingly, some of the splenic TBC were relatively long lived and survived 2 mo or longer. These studies are the first to directly characterize the production of NK cells in situ in normal marrow. We demonstrate that the marrow is the primary site of production of NK cells and that little, if any, proliferation of NK cells occurs in the periphery of unstimulated mice. The data suggest the existence in the bone marrow of at least three compartments in the NK lineage: a rapidly proliferating NK precursor population, a less rapidly proliferating population of large TBC, and a population of small postmitotic TBC.', 'author': 'Pollack SB; Rosse C.', 'source': 'J Immunol 8801; 139(7):2149-56'}\n",

Remarkably, 16.7% of total IgM produced by cord blood cells in response to SAC showed RF activity compared to only 3.4% (p less than 0.0001) of the total IgM produced by SAC-stimulated adult cells. Thus, precursors of IgM RF-secreting cells are not only a consistent feature of the normal adult human B cell repertoire, but they are especially represented at the time of birth.

The VH region homology among the five antibodies was 84 to 100% and the VL region homology was 89 to 99%. The sequence data are consistent with the use of single (or closely related) VH and VL genes encoding the five antibodies. Four antibodies, derived from the same fusion (40-40, 40-120, 40-140, and 40-160), use identical D, JH2, and JK5 gene segments and identical junctions suggesting that they are clonally related. The fifth antibody (35-20) uses different D and JH1 gene segments but the same JK5 gene segment. All five antibodies share a cross-reactive idiotype. The three antibodies that exhibit the greatest degree of homology (40-40, 40-120, and 40-140) also share indistinguishable antigen-binding patterns as well as private idiotopes not present on the other two antibodies. Antibody 40-160, which has the next most homologous sequence, shares idiotopes with the first set but binds preferentially to different sites on the hapten, whereas antibody 35-20 has the most divergent sequence. In general, the degree of sequence homology among the five antibodies correlates with their hierarchical order based on hapten and idiotype fine specificity patterns.', 'author': 'Panka DJ; Margolies MN.', 'source': 'J Immunol 8801; 139(7):2385-91'}\n",

Blood mononuclear leukocytes were exposed to purified neutrophils in the presence of a neutrophil-activating agent (phorbol ester, lectin, or opsonized particle). The treated mononuclear cells displayed a marked decrease in both natural killer activity and mitogen-dependent DNA synthesis, but no change in viability. This functional suppression was dependent on neutrophil number, stimulus concentration, and duration of exposure. Lymphocytes were protected by addition of catalase, but not superoxide dismutase. Neutrophils defective in oxidative metabolism (chronic granulomatous disease) failed to suppress lymphocyte function unless an H2O2-generating system, glucose oxidase plus glucose, was added. The patients' neutrophils provided a factor, possibly myeloperoxidase, which interacted with the glucose oxidase system. The immunosuppressive effect of normal neutrophils was diminished when chloride was omitted from the cultures and was enhanced when chloride was replaced by iodide. Myeloperoxidase-deficient neutrophils were partially defective in suppressing lymphocytes and this was corrected by addition of purified myeloperoxidase. Paradoxically, azide caused enhancement of suppression that depended on the neutrophil oxidative burst, but not on myeloperoxidase and was mediated at least in part by an effect of azide on the target mononuclear leukocytes. These data indicate that suppression of lymphocyte function by activated neutrophils is mediated by the secretion of myeloperoxidase and H2O2 that react with halides to form immunosuppressive products. Moreover, the mononuclear leukocytes contain an azide-sensitive factor, probably catalase, which provides partial protection against injury by neutrophil products. These dynamic interactions may be important local determinants of the immune response.\", 'author': 'el-Hag A; Clark RA.', 'source': 'J Immunol 8801; 139(7):2406-13'}\n",

Thus, ears injected with IgE contained up to six times the total cpm of 125I and up to 30 times the cross-linked 125I-fibrin-associated cpm of 125I than did control ears. Several lines of evidence indicated that the 125I-fibrin deposition associated with the PCA reactions was dependent on the activity of mast cells: 1) Mast cell degranulation occurred at sites of PCA reactions. 2) Antigen-induced influx of 125I-fibrinogen and deposition of 125I-fibrin were virtually abolished by heating the IgE (56 degrees C, 1 hr) before i.d. injection. 3) Little or no IgE-dependent 125I-fibrinogen influx or 125I-fibrin deposition occurred in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv or WCB6F1-S1/S1d mice X 4) Adoptive transfer of cutaneous mast cell populations into WBB6F1-W/Wv mice (by each of three approaches: i.v. transplantation of normal bone marrow cells or local i.d. injection of cultured, growth factor-dependent mast cells 2 days or 9 to 10 wk before antigen challenge) conferred on the recipients the ability to express the 125I-fibrinogen influx and 125I-fibrin deposition associated with PCA reactions.

Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence of monocytes stimulated with opsonized zymosan was inhibited greater than 96% by exposure to adenylate cyclase toxin-containing extract, but not by extracts from adenylate cyclase toxin-deficient mutants. The chemiluminescence responses to particulate (opsonized zymosan, Leishmania donovani, and Staphylococcus aureus) and soluble (phorbol myristate acetate) stimuli were inhibited equivalently. The superoxide anion generation elicited by opsonized zymosan was inhibited 92% whereas that produced by phorbol myristate acetate was inhibited only 32% by B. pertussis extract. Inhibition of oxidative activity was associated with a greater than 500-fold increase in monocyte cAMP levels, but treated monocytes remained viable as assessed by their ability to exclude trypan blue and continued to ingest particulate stimuli. The major role of the adenylate cyclase toxin in the inhibition of monocyte oxidative responses was demonstrated by: 1) little or no inhibition by extracts from B. pertussis mutants lacking adenylate cyclase toxin; 2) high level inhibition with extract from B. parapertussis, a related species lacking pertussis toxin; and 3) a reciprocal relationship between monocyte cAMP levels and inhibition of opsonized zymosan-induced chemiluminescence using both crude extract and partially purified adenylate cyclase toxin.

Factors that regulate biliary [Ca++] in bile are therefore of great importance in the pathogenesis of pigment gallstones. The fate of biliary Ca++ on entry into the gallbladder has not previously been studied. We here report that a minimum of 51.3% +/- 8.8% (SEM) of Ca++ is absorbed from the canine gallbladder on concentration of bile during a 24-hour fast. In addition, there was absorption of least 70.9% +/- 6.2% of Na+, 56.5% +/- 8.6% of K+, and nearly all (greater than 98%) of Cl-. Absorption, neutralization, or both, of HCO3- was also nearly complete (greater than 98%). During concentration of bile by the gallbladder, the concentrations of all biliary cations increased as total bile salt concentration increased, whereas anion concentrations declined. These results are consistent with a Gibbs-Donnan effect induced by impermeable, negatively charged bile salt molecules. Comparison of bile/plasma [Ca++] ratios with those for [K+], a passively distributed ion, was also consistent with, although not proof of, the passive absorption and distribution of Ca++ across the gallbladder epithelium. The absorption of Ca++ by the gallbladder may be a factor in the prevention of pigment gallstones, because it limits free Ca++ ion in bile, and thus decreases the likelihood of precipitation of calcium.', 'author': 'Rege RV; Nahrwold DL; Moore EW.', 'source': 'J Lab Clin Med 8801; 110(4):381-6'}\n",

Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop a hypoperfusion model of ischemic ARF and then to contrast it to a blood flow cessation model (renal artery occlusion). Rats were uninephrectomized, and then temporary (30 or 45 minute) partial aortic ligation (PAL) was created just above the left renal artery, yielding a renal perfusion pressure of 15 to 20 mm Hg and a renal blood flow of 0.1 to 0.2 ml/min. The severity of renal injury was assessed 24 hours later. Azotemia (30-minute PAL: BUN 47 +/- 5 mg/dl; 45-minute PAL: 118 +/- 11 mg/dl), depressed inulin clearances, and extensive pars recta proximal tubular necrosis resulted. Comparing 30 minutes of PAL with 30 minutes of renal artery occlusion revealed far less severe ischemic adenosine triphosphate depletion (P less than 0.001), less azotemia (P less than 0.05), less medullary vascular congestion (P less than 0.05), and less cast formation (P less than 0.05) with PAL. However, both models induced comparable degrees of tubular necrosis, oxidant tissue stress (as assessed by oxidized-reduced glutathione tissue assay), and post-ischemic adenosine triphosphate depletion.

These effects are enhanced by dietary sodium restriction and attenuated by sodium loading. A similar sodium-dependent response of RBF and GFR occurs with the intrarenal injection of adenosine. In view of these similarities, we sought to determine whether endogenous adenosine is involved in the renal hemodynamic response to contrast media. The intrarenal injection of contrast media (meglumine-Na diatrizoate, 76%) in six sodium-depleted, anesthetized dogs resulted in a 17% +/- 4% decrease in RBF and a 31% +/- 5% decrease in GFR. The infusion of the adenosine receptor antagonist, theophylline (5 mumol/min), reduced the decrease in RBF to 6% +/- 2% and in GFR to 12% +/- 3% of control values. During the intrarenal infusion of dipyridamole (24 micrograms/kg/min), a potentiator of adenosine through its action to inhibit the cellular uptake of nucleosides, the hemodynamic response to contrast media was greater; RBF fell 25% +/- 4% and GFR fell 44% +/- 7%. In addition, the urinary excretion of endogenous adenosine increased after the injection of contrast media (388 +/- 79 vs. 830 +/- 231 nmol/min). In summary, the contrast media-induced fall in RBF and GFR was attenuated by theophylline and augmented by dipyridamole, and the administration of contrast media resulted in an increase in the excretion of endogenous adenosine.

We have investigated the effect of a variety of magnesium salts, including sulfate and nonsulfate forms, on cation balance and skeletal muscle ion composition in normal and magnesium-depleted rats. Even modest amounts of dietary sulfate increased the urinary excretion of potassium in both normal and magnesium-depleted rats. During a 7-day feeding period, diets containing MgSO4 or MgO with an equivalent amount of Na2SO4 resulted in significantly greater urinary excretion of potassium than diets without sulfate. In normal animals, this kaliuresis did not produce hypokalemia or muscle potassium depletion. Magnesium-deficient feeding produced magnesium depletion, kaliuresis, and a decline in both plasma and muscle potassium content. When magnesium was restored to the diet without sulfate, urinary potassium excretion decreased, and both magnesium and potassium deficits were corrected.

Although only certain mucosal cells contained iron-binding substances, their number was not increased in iron-deficient animals. Greater quantities of iron and iron-binding substances were observed in duodenal mucosa than in ileal mucosa.

Mixed inocula with 20 or 200 staphylococci and increasing numbers of B. fragilis yielded a dose-dependent increase in the number of staphylococci isolated from osteomyelitic tibiae. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the two inocula and their interaction to be significantly predictive of the 21-day quantitative assessment of staphylococci (r = 0.80). Synergy was most striking at low bacterial inocula. When even large numbers of S. aureus were added to B. fragilis, the B. fragilis inoculum required to initiate B. fragilis osteomyelitis was essentially unchanged. We conclude that small numbers of B. fragilis allow remarkably low numbers of S. aureus (20 or 200 CFU) to establish osteomyelitis in the rat.', 'author': 'Rissing JP; Buxton TB; Horner JA; Shockley RK; Fisher JF; Harris R.', 'source': 'J Lab Clin Med 8801; 110(4):433-8'}\n",

Three groups of rats were studied. All were anesthetized and underwent a baseline measurement of inulin clearance (Cin).

Their susceptibility to photodecomposition by porphyrins was found to be higher than that of proteins with low or no affinity for tetrapyrroles. Inhibition of porphyrin binding by the addition of equimolar amounts of heme had no effect, indicating that protein photodecomposition may be induced, in part, by free or nonspecifically bound porphyrins. HBP, a heme-binding Z protein of liver cytosol, exhibited the highest susceptibility of all proteins tested, including glutathione S-transferases, albumin, hemopexin, and apotransferrin. HBP was extensively photo-oxidized, as evidenced by a decrease in its antigenicity and electrophoretic mobility, and it was cross-linked by naturally occurring porphyrins as well as by the synthetic tin-protoporphyrin and hematoporphyrin derivative. The water-soluble singlet oxygen scavengers L-histidine (50 mmol/L) and sodium azide (100 mmol/L) completely prevented the photodynamic effects of uroporphyrin (100 mumol/L) on HBP. Hydroxyl radical scavengers such as manitol and benzoate were partially effective, whereas water-insoluble singlet oxygen scavengers such as beta-carotene were totally ineffective.

The number of tongues had no influence on the measurements at pressures less than or equal to 7 mm H2O. The elastic modulus of the red cell membrane was calculated; it yielded 2.9 (+/- 0.4) X 10(-3) dynes/cm. Data obtained with filter aspiration were compared with the results obtained concurrently with the micropipette technique. A good correlation was found for normal red cells (r = 0.74, P less than 0.001). Stomatocytes produced by chlorpromazine in vitro had an increased elastic modulus with both methods. For echinocytes produced by salicylate or adenosine triphosphate depletion, the elastic modulus as determined by filter aspiration was normal, but the modulus as measured by micropipette aspiration was increased.

In the future, time use studies can be expected to contribute to the understanding of mental disorders in natural contexts. In contrasting specific diagnostic groups with normal subjects, analyses of specific activities (e.g., personal care, social interaction) or contexts (e.g., alone vs. with others, at home vs. away) may be particularly relevant.

We investigated panic attacks in the natural environment using an event sampling approach. Twenty-seven panic attack patients and 19 matched normal controls kept panic attack and self-exposure diaries for 6 days and wore an ambulatory heart rate/physical activity recorder for 3 days. Patients reported 175 attacks, generally of moderate severity. The most frequent symptoms were palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness, dyspnea, nausea, sweating, and chest pain/discomfort. The results did not support the classification of panic attacks recently proposed by Sheehan and Sheehan, which requires three symptoms as a cutoff for panic attacks. Panic attacks classified by the patients as situational (i.e., occurring in feared situations) were more severe and occurred in situational contexts different from spontaneous attacks, but were otherwise phenomenologically similar. Heart rates did not change during spontaneous attacks and were only mildly elevated during situational attacks or during the 15 minutes preceding these attacks. These heart rate changes were interpretable as effects of anxiety, although physical activity showed a similar pattern of changes. Some normal control subjects reported on the panic diary primarily situational anxiety episodes that were phenomenologically similar to, albeit less severe than, the patients\\' episodes. Panic patients may sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many attacks classified as spontaneous occurred in classical \"phobic\" situations. Furthermore, the comparison of concurrent diary and retrospective interview and questionnaire descriptions showed that panic patients have a tendency toward retrospective exaggeration.

In normal subjects the additional otolithic stimulus evokes compensatory eye movements with a higher gain than with head centred, particularly for high frequency (greater than 0.1 Hz) stimuli. The responses with head centred and eccentric in various patients with known/suspected neuro-otological abnormalities have been compared. Patients with vestibular neurinectomies who have asymmetrical head centred responses showed greater asymmetry with head eccentric at higher stimulus frequencies. Some patients with cerebellar lesions showed abnormally enhanced or depressed and asymmetrical responses with head eccentric in comparison with head centred responses, which could be normal. The enhancing effects could be specific to low frequency stimuli. All patients who showed abnormal responses with head eccentric also had positional nystagmus provoked by the gravity acceleration vector when the head was tilted laterally. The direction of the positional nystagmus with respect to the gravity vector was not necessarily the same as the direction of the effect on eye movements of lateral acceleration during eccentric oscillation.

For the 25 extensor digitorum brevis motor units studied the axonal conduction velocity, the axonal refractory period and the voluntary firing properties were within normal limits. However, high threshold motor units were not observed and the mean value of the axonal conduction velocities was lower (p less than 0.02) for the dystrophia myotonica motor units when compared with corresponding data from healthy subjects. There were also signs of impaired impulse propagation in the terminal part of the motor unit. In muscle biopsy specimens from the anterior tibial muscle, fibre type composition and structure were demonstrated using enzyme histochemical techniques for adenosine-triphosphate and immunohistochemical techniques for identification of the types of myosin isoform present. The histochemical findings indicated a type I fibre dominance, which was most obvious in the more seriously affected muscles. Neonatal myosin was observed preferentially in small but also in some normal sized fibres. Furthermore, some ring fibres were present and these showed staining with antineonatal myosin in their superficial portion. This indicates that an abnormal regeneration is one cause of the myopathic appearance of the muscle fibres in dystrophia myotonica.

In normal brain it was localized to the vasculature, leptomeninges, and pial-glial membrane. In neoplasms type VI collagen and fibronectin codistributed in the vasculature and stromal connective tissue. The GMEM glycoprotein, as identified by monoclonal antibody (MAb) 81C6, and a related glioma-mesenchymal matrix antigen identified by MAb 2A6, were expressed not only in the tumor vasculature and connective tissue, but also within the tumor parenchyma in association with glioma cells.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the amount of apo E released by rat peripheral nerve is increased following selective demyelination, in the absence of significant axonopathy. Using an immunoturbidimetric assay, release of apo E from excised sciatic nerve segments was measured during the phases of acute demyelination and remyelination caused by tellurium (Te) toxicity, during segmental demyelination in chronic lead (Pb) poisoning, and during Wallerian degeneration following nerve crush. Morphologic changes were examined in contralateral sciatic nerves by nerve-fiber teasing or by light and electron microscopy of transverse sections. As in previous studies, the amount of apo E released from the nerves was greatly increased following Wallerian degeneration due to nerve crush. In Te neuropathy, increased release of apo E was first detected on the fourth day of Te exposure, corresponding temporally to the acute onset of paralysis and segmental demyelination. Apolipoprotein E release rose steeply to a maximum of ten times the control values by day 9 and then gradually waned during the next five weeks, corresponding to a period of active remyelination and resolution of the neuropathy. In the demyelinating neuropathy of chronic lead poisoning, apo E release was increased four times over control animals after seven weeks of exposure, with less than 10% of teased fibers showing early paranodal demyelination and no evidence of remyelination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 'author': 'Gelman BB; Rifai N; Goodrum JF; Bouldin TW; Krigman MR.', 'source': 'J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 8801; 46(6):644-52'}\n",

Thus, a selective disruption of oligodendroglial function appears to occur. In order to investigate the in vitro cell tropism of BD virus, primary cultures derived from fetal and adult ovine CNS and peripheral nervous system were inoculated with BD virus. Infected cell types were determined by dual immunofluorescent labeling for viral and cell type specific antigens. Infection of all the major cell types represented in these cultures, including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, fibroblasts, dorsal root ganglion neurons and Schwann cells was found.

The experimental approach enabled direct and unequivocal ultrastructural identification of newly sprouted neuronal processes and their synaptic relationships. Morphologically detectable factors that influence neuronal sprouting were also assessed. Tiny fragments of porous, synthetic membrane were implanted into the mature neocortex of the rat. After one week, axons, dendrites, growth cone-like structures, synapses, and processes from astrocytes and microglia were present deep within the interstices of the implant. Morphometric analysis of synapses within the implant, support the qualitative impression of active neuronal ingrowth and de novo synaptogenesis by these sprouted elements. Astrocytic processes appear to comprise the major barrier to neuronal invasion of the implant. Several observations suggested that glia sometimes may facilitate neuronal ingrowth. These findings provide direct morphological documentation of axonal and dendritic plasticity in the mature rat neocortex.

The resorption of Evans blue, a marker of protein extravasation, was delayed in x-irradiated mice on the second day following a freeze lesion (p = 0.0075), which correlates with a delay in macrophage infiltration around the lesion. The specific gravity of the lesion and its border regions was significantly less in x-irradiated animals on day 7 than in controls (p = 0.00062), which correlates with a delay in new vessel formation around the lesion. Administration of corticosteroids from the time of production of the freeze lesion resulted in a specific gravity significantly less than control when measured eight days after the lesion (p = 0.01). Macrophages may participate by inhibiting the development of the macromolecular portion of vasogenic edema.

In all patients, the results of the tests performed, including evoked potentials, CT scanning, oligoclonal bands in the CSF and myelography, were normal or inconclusive and did not lead to the correct diagnosis of the aetiology. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provided the diagnosis of the causative process: multiple sclerosis in four cases, meningioma of the craniocervical junction or upper thoracic spinal cord in two cases, and upper cervical cord low-grade astrocytoma in one case. The patients with tumour could be treated effectively. Without MRI, however, the correct diagnosis would have been delayed. T2-weighted spin-echo scans provided maximal sensitivity for the detection of MS plaques, although they lacked specificity for a special disease. Several morphological criteria during MRI were helpful in differentiating Binswanger\\'s disease, leucodystrophy and adrenoleucodystrophy from MS. It is concluded that at present MRI is the only non-invasive test with which to screen reliably the craniocervical junction and the upper cervical level, both of which are diagnostically difficult regions.

Regardless of ER status or menopausal status, the addition of tamoxifen conferred no significant advantage in response rate, response duration, time to treatment failure (TTF) or survival over CAF alone. A secondary objective was to compare the response to CAF of ER positive (ER+) and ER negative (ER-) patients to determine if there was a differential response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Response rates of ER+ and ER- patients to CAF were identical (56%), but the response duration, time to treatment failure, and survival of ER+ patients were significantly longer than ER- patients. This lack of differential response implies that chemotherapy and hormonal therapy may compete for the same pool of ER+ cells.

Cisplatin (65 mg/m2) in normal saline was administered IP with a two-hour dwell time in ten Beagle dogs. Five of the ten dogs were randomly selected to receive concurrent regional microwave-producing HT at approximately 41.5 degrees C (IP) for a 60-minute period.

When an expanded Kiel containing an intermediate grade (IG) composed of the original LG diffuse group was devised, this gave a much better separation of survival of the three grades as compared with the WF where the survival of IG and HG forms were nonsignificantly different. The main reason for this difference was the inclusion of the so-called centroblastic diffuse form in the HG Kiel, but in the IG according to the WF. In a \"modified\" WF analysis where this histologic entity was placed in the HG subgroup, the three survival curves then gave excellent separation like the expanded Kiel classification.

Twenty-two patients had high-grade gliomas (13 glioblastomas, six recurrent glioblastomas, two anaplastic astrocytomas, and one recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma) and one had a right frontal metastasis from a carcinoma of the lung. Hematoporphyrin derivative was administered to these patients in a dose of 5 mg/kg and, 24 hours later, they all underwent a craniotomy with radical excision of the tumor. The tumor bed was then irradiated with 630 nm of laser light from either an argon dye laser or a gold metal vapor laser for between 43 and 94 minutes, receiving total doses of 70 to 120 J/sq cm (six cases) or 120 to 230 J/sq cm (17 cases). The temperature of the tumor bed was kept below 37 degrees C by irrigation. Fifteen patients who developed new tumors underwent postoperative radiotherapy (45 Gy in 20 divided doses). There was no evidence of increased cerebral edema and no other toxicity from the therapy. All patients were discharged from the hospital within 18 days of surgery. Four of seven patients with gliomas have suffered a further recurrence at 12 to 16 weeks, and two of 15 patients with primarily treated gliomas experienced recurrence at 3 and 13 months following therapy.

Venous drainage was similarly stereotypic, with predominant outflow into the galenic system in all but one patient. An interhemispheric surgical approach was used in eight patients, a middle or inferior temporal gyrus incision was performed in six, and a subtemporal route was chosen in a single patient. Operative results suggest that these lesions can be removed with reasonable safety. An interhemispheric approach is recommended if the nidus projects medially from the trigone and is observed medial to the P2-P3 junction of the PCA on angiography. A middle temporal gyrus approach is suggested if the nidus is lateral to the P2-P3 junction, even when the lesion is located in the dominant hemisphere.

A Grade I cistern predicted a good outcome whether the hematoma was evacuated or not, as long as obstructive hydrocephalus, if present, was relieved early. However, a Grade II cistern was not predictive of a good outcome unless the hematoma was evacuated within 48 hours after onset of the hemorrhage.

Standard microsurgical techniques were used to dissect bilaterally the major cerebral arteries free of arachnoid. An autologous blood clot averaging 4.2 gm was placed around the vessels in the subarachnoid space of the monkeys in the 48-hour, 72-hour, 96-hour, and clot groups.

Brain tissue resistance, tissue compliance, and the pressure-volume index were analyzed in response to a bolus injection of saline into brain tissue or the cisterna magna. Cerebrovascular resistance was also calculated. In craniectomized animals 2 hours after surgery, ICP had fallen to 3.75 +/- 0.39 mm Hg, and cortical gray and white matter tissue pressure had fallen to 3.19 +/- 0.47 and 4.69 +/- 0.54 mm Hg, respectively (mean +/- standard error of the mean); these variables did not fall further over 4 hours.

Injury to adrenergic neurons by 6-hydroxydopamine substantially reduced the uptake of [125I] MIBG into the left ventricle, but the effect was less than that on uptake of [3H]NE uptake and concentration of endogenous NE. Similarly, when desmethylimipramine was given to inhibit the uptake-1 pathway of neurons, the reduction in uptake of [125I]MIBG was statistically significant but less than that of [3H]NE; part of this difference may be attributable to partial uptake of [125I]MIBG into neurons by a diffusion pathway.

It appears that several factors are contributing to this role change. Patient acuity has increased the time needed to administer physical care. The nursing shortage means more patients are assigned to each professional nurse and paraprofessionals are doing more patient care. There is less and less time left for the primary nurse to practice the professional attributes of nursing, primarily discharge planning. This function is shifting to the UR Department. Is discharge planning a function nurse executives wish to relinquish? Finally, we are entering another period of severe nurse shortages, where recruitment and retention of staff are paramount. Actively competing for our staff are the UR departments. Forty professional nurses work in three regional centers of the American Health Network, American Group Insurance Company (Dallas, Texas). In one hospital of 450 beds, nine nurses are employed by the UR department.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\", 'author': 'Cronenwett LR.', 'source': 'J Nurs Adm 8801; 17(9):6-8'}\n",

In addition, inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation by apyrase (0.06 U/mL) was identical in the two groups.

Adaptation to a high fiber diet containing 15% guar gum (GG) or gum arabic (GA) was thus studied in rats previously adapted to a high starch fiber-free diet. Both gums elicited a marked enlargement of the cecum and a trophic effect on the cecal wall. The cecal pH dropped to 5.8, then plateaued to about 6.1. During the first days of adaptation, a part of GA escaped microbial degradation; thereafter the cecal pool of volatile fatty acids (VFA) was similar with both diets (approximately equal to 1000 mumol). GA promoted propionate-rich fermentations, whereas GG rather enhanced acetic and butyric fermentations.

Local ganglionic blocking doses (total of 5 mg per injection) of hexamethonium were injected into the pulmonary vein-atrial fat pad to block selectively right and left vagal inputs to the SAN region without interrupting vagal inputs to AVN. Conversely, hexamethonium injected into the inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial pad selectively blocked vagal control of arteriovenous conduction without interfering seriously with vagal control of SAN function. Vagal ganglia situated in pulmonary vein-atrial fat pad also exercise moderate but incomplete control of right atrial contractile force. Lesser vagal control of atrial inotropism is localized in the inferior vena cava-inferior left atrial fat pad. Ganglia situated in a large fat pad on the dorsal epicardial surface of the left atrium (left atrial fat pad) appear to play little or no role in SAN or AVN regulation, although some left preganglionic axons may pass through it en route to the AVN region. Vagal stimulation is associated with prompt and profoundly negative chronotropic and dromotropic responses, but in response to the same stimulation, a negative change in atrial contractile force is much slower in development and is much longer lasting.

Therefore, the binding sites displayed a higher affinity for LTC4 than for the other sulfidopeptide LTs. Computer-assisted analysis of either the saturation or the competition curves for LTC4 indicated the existence of two classes of binding sites with different affinities (Kd1 and Kd2 = 70 nM and 0.58 microM, respectively), in agreement with the curved semilog plot of the dissociation time course. CaCl2 or MgCl2 increased and GTP or 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate did not decrease the specific binding. In addition, the distribution of the binding sites for [3H]LTC4 along the human respiratory tree was investigated. At a fixed (10 nM) [3H]LTC4 concentration, membranes obtained from bronchi removed at different levels of the airway tree did not bind LTC4 in a significantly different amount. This is compatible with the finding that LTC4 receptors should be present on bronchi of various caliber, as both small and large airways respond to LTs.\", 'author': 'Civelli M; Oliva D; Mezzetti M; Nicosia S.', 'source': 'J Pharmacol Exp Ther 8801; 242(3):1019-24'}\n",

All three compounds increased heart rate in the former preparations, and their intrinsic activities relative to isoproterenol were 0.7, 0.65 and 0.45, respectively. The positive chronotropic effects of cicloprolol or xamoterol were competitively antagonized by betaxolol or propranolol; however, part of those induced by pindolol were resistant to these beta adrenoceptor antagonists. None of these compounds increased the spontaneous beating rate of isolated guinea pig atria; however, xamoterol only increased heart rate in isolated rat atria, and its intrinsic activity with respect to isoproterenol was 0.4. Pindolol, xamoterol and cicloprolol behaved as competitive beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists against isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in a pithed rat model. In order to mimic the intrinsic effects of the partial agonist drugs, control dose-response curves for isoproterenol were determined in pithed rats in which the base-line heart rate was elevated by thoracic spinal cord stimulation. In this in vivo preparation, xamoterol and pindolol were more potent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists than cicloprolol; however, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were selective for beta-1 adrenoceptors. In isolated spontaneously beating guinea pig right atria, cicloprolol and xamoterol were equipotent beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonists but were about 50 times less potent than pindolol. In isolated rat atria, the beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist potency of xamoterol was greater (pA2 = 8.7) than in guinea pig atria (pA2 = 7.8). The potencies of cicloprolol and pindolol did not vary between these species. In catecholamine-depleted rats, high i.v. doses of cicloprolol had vasodilator activity that was partly mediated by beta-2 adrenoceptors. In carbachol-contracted guinea pig trachea, cicloprolol and xamoterol, in contrast to pindolol, were relatively inactive against isoproterenol-induced relaxation.

Moreover, the distribution of dog fat cell adrenoceptors and the functional consequences were explored in fat deposits from different anatomical locations (perirenal, omental and s.c. adipose tissue). Beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptors involved in the control of the lipolytic activity of dog fat cells exhibit pharmacological characteristics which are very similar to those defined in human adipocytes. However, in contrast with the results obtained in human adipocytes, there is a preponderance of beta over alpha-2 adrenergic binding sites, whatever the location of the fat deposits, in the dog. The higher values of the ratio beta-sites over alpha-2-sites were found in perirenal adipocytes whereas the lowest values of this ratio were found in s.c. deposits. A close positive relationship exist between alpha-2 adrenoceptor number, alpha-2 adrenergic responsiveness and fat cell volume. To conclude, beta and alpha-2 adrenoceptors exhibit similar pharmacological properties in dog and human fat cells.

This effect, which is apparent with both 15- and 60-min preincubation periods, is mimicked by 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine, blocked by 8-phenyltheophylline but not dipyridamole and is associated with the ability of adenosine to elevate cyclic AMP. The second, which is mimicked by 3-deazaadenosine and is associated only with the longer 60-min preincubation period, is reversed by dipyridamole but not by 8-phenyltheophylline suggesting it to be an intracellular mechanism. Its enhancement by homocysteine thiolactone and reversal by exogenous S-adenosyl methionine suggests it to result from increasing intracellular S-adenosyl homocysteine levels. Our failure to detect increased 3H-methyl incorporation into chloroform-methanol extractable lipids after immunoglobulin E-dependent activation would indicate that inhibition of S-adenosyl methionine methylation reactions are an unlikely mechanism. As both prior stimulation of A2-purinoceptors and elevation of intracellular S-adenosyl homocysteine enhance and prolong the cyclic AMP response consequent upon immunoglobulin E-dependent activation, this represents a common mechanism by which histamine release may be suppressed.\", 'author': 'Hughes PJ; Benyon RC; Church MK.', 'source': 'J Pharmacol Exp Ther 8801; 242(3):1064-70'}\n",

The 5-HT1A agonists 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin and p-aminophenyl-ethyl-m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine produced a dose-related inhibition of sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) recorded from either the postganglionic inferior cardiac nerve or the preganglionic splanchnic nerve in chloralose-anesthetized cats. The sympatholytic effects of 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin and p-aminophenyl-ethyl-m-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine were accompanied by hypotension and bradycardia. The effects of 5-HT1A agonists were reversed by the 5-HT1A antagonist spiperone. In contrast, spiperone alone produced decreases in blood pressure, heart rate and SND. The 5-HT1B agonists 1[3(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]-piperazine, 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine and 1-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine all produced variable effects on SND. In some experiments, SND was increased by these agents, whereas it was decreased in others. The 5-HT2 agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane produced a marked increase in SND. A second 5-HT2 agonist, MK212, produced similar effects. The role of 5-HT receptor subtypes in mediating the 5-HT excitation of sympathetic neurons is discussed.

If cerebral autoregulation involves stretch-sensitive diltiazem-resistant calcium channels, then autoregulation should remain intact during vasodilatation produced by diltiazem. The present study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Using a canine cerebral venous outflow preparation, experiments were first performed to determine the optimum dose and route of administration for diltiazem. Although continuous i.v. diltiazem (1-100 micrograms/kg/min) did not increase cerebral perfusion at any normotensive dose, i.a. (lingual artery) diltiazem at 10.0 micrograms/kg/min increased cerebral blood flow by 36% and decreased cerebrovascular resistance by 31% without significant effects on blood gas levels, cerebral oxygen uptake, cardiac output or mean arterial pressure. In autoregulation experiments, 10.0 micrograms/kg/min of diltiazem significantly attenuated but did not eliminate autoregulatory responses to increases (inflation of an aortic balloon) and decreases (hemorrhage) in cerebral perfusion pressure. Autoregulatory responses to increases and decreases in perfusion pressure were equally affected by diltiazem, but both were unaffected by i.a. saline. These data support the view that cerebral autoregulation involves both diltiazem-sensitive and diltiazem-resistant mechanisms.

Because L363 competitively displaces muscarinic agonists fand antagonists from their specific recognition sites, one might infer that the two recognition sites interact functionally; that is, somatostatin reduces the efficacy of oxotremorine and/or vice versa.\", 'author': 'Eva C; Costa E.', 'source': 'J Pharmacol Exp Ther 8801; 242(3):888-94'}\n",

Animals were administered a transitional dose (1.75 mg/kg) of amphetamine with regard to the induction of locomotion and continuous stereotypy. On the basis of individual response profiles animals could be separated into two markedly different subgroups, one displaying continuous locomotion (S1), characteristic of lower amphetamine doses, and the other exhibiting a multiphasic pattern, including a prolonged focused stereotypy phase (S2), typically associated with higher amphetamine doses. Examination of regional brain monoamine and metabolite levels revealed distinguishing patterns between the subgroups only in the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine systems. With repeated amphetamine administration, the two prominent factors of the augmentation, the emergence of stereotypy and the enhancement of locomotion during the last half of the response, were dissociable between the subgroups. The emergence of stereotypy was confined to S1 animals, whereas only the S2 subgroup displayed the progressive increase in locomotion. Differences in the responsiveness of neurochemical systems to amphetamine rather than pharmacokinetic factors appear to underly the distinct behavioral profiles associated with the two subgroups.

A majority of 125I-AIII metabolism was due to soluble peptidases, whereas that of 125I-AII primarily resulted from membrane-bound peptidases. AM, BE and reduced incubation temperatures significantly decreased the metabolism of 125I-AII and 125I-AIII. After appropriate adjustments to reflect the proportion of intact radioligand bound, temperature- or inhibitor-induced decreases in metabolism were matched by corresponding increases in specific binding. Heat-treated bovine serum albumin, as a nonspecific peptidase inhibitor, had no effect on either the metabolism or binding of the ligands used. In accordance with their actions in vitro, i.c.v. administration of AM and BE prolonged the pressor activity of subsequently applied AII and AIII. Unexpectedly, the amplitude of the pressor response to AIII was increased by BE, whereas that to AII was decreased by AM.

Anesthetic drugs, including barbiturates, chloroform, diethylether and ethanol, inhibited the binding of TBPS and enhanced the GABA-dependent influx of chloride. In the presence of bicuculline, barbiturates increased the binding of TBPS, but this action was not shared by other anesthetic agents. Inhibition of TBPS binding was found with drug concentrations that produce anesthesia in vivo, whereas augmentation of GABA action occurred at subanesthetic concentrations. Effects of a series of n-alcohols (methanol to decanol) were studied on TBPS binding and membrane fluidity (using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene as a fluorescent probe). The potencies of the alcohols for inhibiting TBPS binding and fluidizing synaptic membranes were similar to their anesthetic potencies, but there were differences in the relative potencies of the drugs for inhibition of TBPS binding and membrane fluidization.

Changes in the plan can either sustain institutional values or introduce new priorities. In view of physicians' loyalty to a particular plan and their anxiety in the face of change, the authors suggest that it may be better to modify an established plan than to impose a new system. The physicians interviewed agreed that strong chairmen can work within any plan to reward faculty members for research, clinical, or administrative contributions and thus to determine a department's directions and character.

The results show that the physicians recalled significantly more critical cues than the medical students.

The medical students were unaffected by problem type or structural form in the amount of information they recalled.

The average initial T was 35 degrees C, with no seasonal variation. Injury severity and survival correlated with severe hypothermia. Normothermic patients had an average ISS of 28 with a 78% survival. Severely hypothermic patients had an average ISS of 36 with a 41% survival (p less than 0.05).

In the course of performing 312 radical retropubic prostatectomies the neurovascular bundle was widely excised unilaterally in 49 men with advanced clinical disease in whom, based on preoperative or intraoperative assessment, the bundle appeared to be involved by tumor. Because of this selection criterion these patients had higher clinical stage (52 per cent had clinical stage B2) and pathological stage (35 per cent had microscopic involvement of pelvic lymph nodes) disease than our previously reported series. In 38 patients the margins of resection were negative for tumor. In 11 patients despite attempts at wide excision of the lesion the surgical margins of resection were positive. In all 11 men with positive surgical margins there was extensive periprostatic extension of tumor and 8 had involvement of the pelvic lymph nodes. However, in none of the 11 patients with positive surgical margins were the margins positive only at the site where the bundle was spared, which shows that unilateral sparing of the neurovascular bundle did not compromise removal of tumor. Of the 29 men who were potent preoperatively and who have been followed for 1 year or longer postoperatively 20 (69 per cent) are potent. The return of sexual function correlated with age: 5 of 5 men (100 per cent) 40 to 49 years old were potent postoperatively compared to 8 of 10 (80 per cent) 50 to 59 years old and 7 of 14 (50 per cent) 60 to 69 years old. Histological evaluation of the resected specimens revealed that some of the men who were potent postoperatively had soft tissue and nerves resected in the region of the contralateral spared neurovascular bundle. By measuring nerves in the spared region of the neurovascular bundle we found that the role of the neurovascular bundles in potency is not owing to large nerves but to many nerves of varying size. In conclusion, potency can be maintained after radical prostatectomy in most patients in whom it is necessary to excise 1 neurovascular bundle widely without compromising the removal of tumor.', 'author': 'Walsh PC; Epstein JI; Lowe FC.', 'source': 'J Urol 8801; 138(4):823-7'}\n",

The incubated tissues were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis and radiofluorography. Over 100 spots were developed in the fluorograms. Three groups of spots, representing cytoskeletal proteins, androgen-dependent proteins and castration-induced proteins, were further evaluated by a computer-based densitometer. The level of densitometry absorption is proportional to the amount of radioactivity in each spot. The synthesis of cytoskeletal proteins, such as actin and tropomyosin, were relatively constant throughout the course of prostatic regression. The rate of synthesis of androgen-dependent proteins declined rapidly from a high level of synthesis before castration to a non-detectable level by Day 3 postcastration. However, three proteins, which were either not synthesized (spot G and spot H) or synthesized at a very low level (spot I) before castration, were the major proteins synthesized by the prostate during early stages of its regression. The rate of synthesis of these proteins reached a peak by Day 4 postcastration, declined rapidly and remained at a low level thereafter. The respective molecular weights and isoelectric points for these three proteins were 33 Kd and 7.2 for spot G, 38 Kd and 5.3 for spot H and 64 Kd and 6.0 for spot I. Previous findings showed that prostatic regression in rats was associated with a surge of activities in proteolytic enzymes which peaked five to six days postcastration. The peak of synthesis of three proteins noted in the present study, therefore, preceded the peak of activities of proteolytic enzymes in the regressing prostate by one to two days. Testosterone replacement to animals at the time of castration prevented the synthesis of these proteins in the prostate. Since the synthesis of these three proteins in the ventral prostate is induced by androgen-depletion resulted from castration, they are considered as the castration-induced proteins.', 'author': 'Lee C; Sensibar JA.', 'source': 'J Urol 8801; 138(4):903-8'}\n",

Male pseudohermaphrodites, patients with mixed gonadal dysgenesis and male patients with a micropenis may not be so straightforward, and proper gender assignment in these infants may be difficult. A unified surgical approach to early reconstruction of the external genitalia in these patients, who are to be reared as female subjects, has been developed. Essential to this perineal reconstruction are phallic reduction and recession in which erectile tissue is removed with preservation of the neurovascular bundles and glans, creation of labia minora from flaps of phallic skin and foreskin, a labioscrotal Y-V plasty to produce normal-appearing labia majora and construction of a neovagina with a perineal flap. If the patient is a male pseudohermaphrodite or an infant with a micropenis creation of the vagina is deferred until late adolescence or young adulthood. In other patients in whom the vagina enters the urethra or urogenital sinus proximal to the external sphincter a pullthrough vaginoplasty is performed when the child is 2 to 3 years old. If the vaginal entry is distal to the external urinary sphincter a flap vaginoplasty is performed at the same time as the phallic reduction, and creation of the labia minora and labia majora during infancy.

Height, weight, blood pressure, urine cultures and serum creatinine measurements also were obtained. Isotope cystography was used for followup examinations. A single, negative isotope cystogram was the radiological criterion for cessation of reflux. The charts of 545 children (55 per cent had bilateral reflux) with 844 refluxing ureters were reviewed. Based upon the international classification vesicoureteral reflux was grade I in 6.6 per cent of the cases, grade II in 54.2 per cent, grade III in 31.6 per cent, grade IV in 5.7 per cent and grade V in 1.9 per cent. All children were kept on long-term continuous prophylactic antibiotics and they were re-evaluated annually with isotope cystography. The followup rate for the entire group was 88 per cent. During the observation period spontaneous resolution of reflux was noted in 36 per cent of the patients and 39 per cent of the total refluxing ureters. Only 13 per cent of the entire group underwent surgical correction of reflux. Presently, 39 per cent (215) of the patients continue to be followed with reflux. Of the total group 66 patients (12 per cent) were lost to followup. In the 194 patients with spontaneous resolution of reflux the mean duration of reflux was 1.69 years, with 30 to 35 per cent resolving each year. Based on Student's t test there was a significant difference in duration of reflux in patients with grade II compared to grade III reflux (1.56 versus 1.97 years, p less than 0.04).

A modification of the Gil-Vernet vertical lumbotomy incision was used in all cases. This approach involves successive incisions through the layers of the lumbodorsal fascia to gain access to the kidney and ureter, and emphasizes a muscle-retracting technique.

The drug was administered subcutaneously in 3 doses (10, 20 and 40 mg. per kg. daily) for 14 days. Cyclosporine A administration resulted in a dose-dependent decline in body and reproductive organ weights, histology of the testis showed definite degenerative changes, and sperm counts and motility decreased. Spermatozoa from treated rats retained the cytoplasmic droplet and they were decapitated. Consequently, sterility occurred in rats treated with high doses of cyclosporine A. A reduction in circulating testosterone and an increase in gonadotropins were noted. The possibility existed that the cyclosporine A-induced alterations in the male reproductive system were secondary to the hepatic or nephrotoxic effects of the drug. Therefore, we assessed liver and kidney function by assay of the serum levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase and creatinine. Except for an increase in bilirubin, none of the other liver function studies was altered, thereby eliminating hepatocellular damage as the etiology of impaired reproductive function in cyclosporine A-treated rats. We observed an increase in creatinine levels in animals treated with higher doses of cyclosporine A, consistent with mild renal failure.

In this study of 932 patients entered into the computer registry of the Cleveland Vascular Society, 19 surgeons representing 13 community hospitals and referral centers in Cleveland and Akron report the intermediate-term outcome during a mean interval of 35 months after infrainguinal lower extremity revascularization performed in northeastern Ohio from 1978 through 1982. Operative risk (5%), the early amputation rate (7%), and actuarial 5-year survival (48% to 55%) for patients with rest pain or tissue necrosis were significantly worse (p less than 0.05) than comparable figures (0.6%, 0%, and 77%, respectively) for others who underwent procedures for disabling claudication. Although both materials had similar success above the knee, the cumulative 3-year patency rate of autogenous vein bypass to the distal popliteal (69% to 88%; p less than 0.05) and tibioperoneal arteries (43%; 0.05 less than p less than 0.1) was superior to the results of polytetrafluoroethylene grafts (32% to 50% and 19%, respectively).

Research is hampered by a lack of experimental models that appropriately mimic clinical situations. A new model of paraplegia in the rat is presented and evaluated by standard neurologic deficit scoring (1, 4, 18, and 24 hours after occlusion) and by computerized activity monitoring (1 and 18 hours after occlusion). Rats underwent temporary occlusion of the thoracic aorta for 10, 15, or 20 minutes. Experimental groups received glucose (2 gm/kg) and demonstrated a significant elevation in blood glucose (p = 0.001) and were significantly more neurologically impaired at all four time periods (p less than or equal to 0.005) than the ischemic control group, which received equivalent volumes of normal saline solution. Significant differences in neurologic deficit were noted with direct clinical examination and computerized activity monitoring. With the use of the latter system, statistical differences were detected in total distance traveled and number of vertical movements. We conclude the following: (1) Paraplegia is reliably and reproducibly achieved in this rat model; (2) because of the rat's more extensive behavioral repertoire when compared with other models of spinal ischemia (e.g., rabbit), more end points can be monitored and more subtle behavioral deficits discerned; (3) computerized activity monitoring can distinguish varying degrees of neurologic deficit and correlates with clinical neurologic deficit scoring; and (4) glucose exacerbates paraplegia in this model.\", 'author': \"LeMay DR; Neal S; Neal S; Zelenock GB; D'Alecy LG.\", 'source': 'J Vasc Surg 8801; 6(4):383-90'}\n",

In contrast with conventional hyperthermia, pulsed lasers rapidly induce extremely high temperatures confined to small areas within the tissues. It is not established, however, how cellular damage and repair responses differ between conventional and pulsed laser-induced hyperthermia. We have addressed this question by examining the induction of cellular heat-shock proteins (HSPs) and protection by heat-shock response against pulsed laser vs conventional hyperthermia. Cultured human dermal fibroblasts at confluency were exposed to single microsecond, 10.6-microns-wavelength pulses from a pulsed CO2 laser at radiant exposures between 0 and 1.3 J/cm2. Cell monolayers were directly exposed after removal of overlying medium. Positive control for the ability of the cells to synthesize of HSPs was obtained by heating the cells for 20 min in a water bath at 45 degrees C or 47 degrees C. The cultures were then labeled with L-[35S] methionine (Met), and proteins analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 2 hr after exposure. The morphological alterations induced by laser or heat were similar under phase contrast microscopy. Conventional heating induced a heat-shock response, with the appearance of HSPs 2 hours after heating. In contrast, synthesis of HSPs could not be detected following laser irradiation, even at exposures decreasing both cell viability and incorporation of [35S] Met into cellular protein. Pre-exposure of cells to temperatures which induced synthesis of HSPs, however, significantly decreased cell death induced by subsequent laser irradiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 'author': 'Polla BS; Anderson RR.', 'source': 'Lasers Surg Med 8804; 7(5):398-404'}\n",

After four days of recovery, catheter-directed neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser injury was produced at the site of earliest recorded electrical activation during pacing tachycardia as detected by endocardial catheter mapping. Immediately after laser injury and again five days after injury, pacing tachycardia was attempted. Failure to pace after laser injury was defined as successful arrhythmia ablation. In 3/9 (33%) experiments, the laser-injured tissue surrounded the tachycardia source (pacing wires), and pacing-simulated ventricular tachycardia was prevented. When the laser injury did not involve the tachycardia source, 6/9 animals, due to limitations of the mapping system, pacing was not prevented. One animal developed sustained ventricular tachycardia during laser injury, with conversion to sinus rhythm by lidocaine.

When single serum samples from 92 men were studied, 73 percent had detectable hCG. In normal men, the amount of detectable hCG averaged 8.9 pg per milliliter, with a range of less than 3.0 to 160 pg per milliliter (biologic potency = 13,450 IU per milligram). In postmenopausal women the hCG level averaged 111 pg per milliliter and ranged from 32 to 510. In women of reproductive age the hCG level varied with the menstrual cycle. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone administered to 10 normal men increased both hCG and hLH. When daily serum samples were studied throughout a normal menstrual cycle, hCG concentrations paralleled those of hLH; follicular-phase concentrations were higher than those of the luteal phase, and there was a midcycle ovulatory peak of hCG coincident with the hLH peak. When hCG was measured every 10 minutes for six hours in eight postmenopausal women, distinct pulses were detected in parallel with those of hLH: hLH pulsed at a mean (+/- SEM) frequency of 0.56 +/- 0.08 pulses per hour; hCG pulsed at 0.54 +/- 0.07 pulses per hour. The mean pulse durations were 89 +/- 22 and 56 +/- 20 minutes for hLH and hCG, respectively. We conclude that hCG is produced in a pulsatile fashion, probably by the pituitary, in all normal adults.', 'author': 'Odell WD; Griffin J.', 'source': 'N Engl J Med 8804; 317(27):1688-91'}\n",

Brain binding sites have been identified for both the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 subtypes. Receptors of the 5-HT3 type have been characterized on isolated peripheral tissue models such as the rat vagus nerve, guinea-pig ileum and isolated rabbit heart. Using these models, selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as MDL 72222 (ref. 5), ICS 205-930 (ref. 6), GR38032F (ref. 7) and BRL 43694 (ref. 8) have been developed. Recently, GR38032F, MDL 72222 and ICS 205-930 have been shown to have behavioural effects in rodents and primates that undoubtedly reflect an action in the central nervous system (refs 9-11 and unpublished observations), suggesting the existence of 5-HT3 receptors in the brain. Here we report direct evidence for the existence of 5-HT3 receptors in rat brain tissue and their distribution, based on high affinity binding of the potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist 3H-GR65630 to homogenates of rat entorhinal cortex. Selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and agonists inhibited binding of 3H-GR65630 with high affinities which correlated well with their actions on the rat isolated vagus nerve.

Such complex behaviour can be analysed using methods derived from chaos theory, which is concerned with the non-linear dynamics of deterministic systems that have irregular periodicities as well as an exquisite sensitivity to the initial conditions. We report here that the general response patterns of non-oscillatory cardiac conducting tissues, when driven rhythmically by repetitive stimuli from their surroundings, are similar to those of other deterministic systems showing chaotic dynamics. Such patterns include phase locking, period-doubling bifurcation and irregular activity. We have used electrophysiological techniques and analytical arguments to explain this unforeseen behaviour and to provide some key information about its mechanisms. The study of these dynamics is of general application to the understanding of disordered phenomena in excitable media, and may provide new insight about the origin of fatal cardiac arrhythmias.', 'author': 'Chialvo DR; Jalife J.', 'source': 'Nature 8804; 330(6150):749-52'}\n",

Activation of apical-membrane Cl- channels by cyclic AMP-mediated stimuli is defective in CF airway epithelial cells, despite normal agonist-induced increases in cellular cAMP levels. This defect in Cl- channel regulation has been localized to the apical membrane by exposing the cytoplasmic surface of excised membrane patches to the catalytic subunit (C subunit) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and ATP. In membranes from normal cells, C-subunit activated Cl- channels with properties identical to those stimulated by cAMP-dependent agonists during cell-attached recording. Activation by the C subunit was not observed in CF membranes, but the presence of Cl- channels was verified by voltage-induced activation. The failure of the C subunit to activate the Cl- channels of CF membranes indicates that the block in their cAMP-mediated activation lies distal to induction of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity and focuses our attention on the Cl- channel and its membrane-associated regulatory proteins as the probable site of the CF defect.', 'author': 'Schoumacher RA; Shoemaker RL; Halm DR; Tallant EA; Wallace RW; Frizzell RA.', 'source': 'Nature 8804; 330(6150):752-4'}\n"
